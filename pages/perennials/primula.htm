                <p>Primroses have been a vibrant addition to the spring, woodland garden and containers for over a century. The name <em>Primula</em> is derived from the Italian word for spring <em>primavera</em>. An explosion of color in every shade of the rainbow, primroses primarily prefer cooler temperatures and therefore bloom early spring through May.</p>

                <p>Primroses combine fabulously with spring bulbs, evergreen grasses and dusty miller. Some species such as <em>Primula marginata</em> are more diminutive and perfect for rock gardens or trough containers. Other species such as <em>Primula japonica</em> and <em>Primula veris</em> reseed and create naturalized drifts in the shade garden.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The many types of primroses are divided into three basic categories. Candelabra types (i.e. <em>Primula capita</em> and <em>Primula japonica</em>) show off their flowers in tiered clusters of 6-8 blooms on 1-2 ½ ‘ stems. They are often short lived, prefer damp soil and reseed.</p>

                <p>Polyanthus types (i.e. <em>Primula vulgaris&nbsp;</em>and <em>Primula veris</em>) bear bunches of flowers on 6-8” stems and bloom winter and/or early spring. This group includes the common primroses sold as color spots.</p>

                <p>The third group is evergreen and heralds from mountainous areas. This includes <em>Primula auricula</em> which has small clusters of flat topped flowers in a unique range of color. They also have distinctive thick leaves with a powdery coating on the underside. These types are often grown in pots since they need sharp drainage and lime.</p>

                <p>Here at Portland Nursery we will be carrying a wide range of Primroses this spring. We will have a rainbow of colors and types. Drop in to see what is new and blooming!</p>

Most of the English primroses are treated as annuals, and bloom until the weather gets hot. They can be perennial if given good drainage and regular fertilizer around bloom time.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Primulaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Primula</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Primrose, Cowslip</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Around 400 species are found mostly through out the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Primroses are woodland dwellers that prefer morning sun, dappled sun or full shade. They thrive in fertile, well-drained, acidic soil with regular water (except <em>Primulaauricula</em> like alkaline soil).</p>

                        <p>Some species such as <em>Primula japonica</em> and <em>Primula veris</em> are wetland dwellers while others such as <em>Primula auricula</em> are mountain species perfect for the rock garden.</p>

                        <p>The majority of primroses are perennial in the Portland area. <em>Primula malicoides</em> (fairy primrose) and <em>Primula obconica</em> (poison primrose) are delightful early spring annuals.</p>

                        <p><em>Primula vulgaris</em> is often sold along with pansies as color spots and treated as annuals, but have the potential to be a short lived perennial given the right conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Remove yellowing leaves whenever present. Divide older plants after they finish blooming.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional qualities:</strong> Attracts hummingbirds, bees and butterflies. Possible cut flower or rock garden plant. Long bloom time. Some species tolerate wet soils.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pest and Diseases:</strong> Slugs, snails, root weevil, root rot, botrytis and powdery mildew can all affect primroses.</p>
