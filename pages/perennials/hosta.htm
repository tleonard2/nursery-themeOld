                <p>Flexibility and diversity are the first two words that spring to mind when thinking of <em>hostas</em>. There are over 3000 registered cultivars of <em>hosta</em>!</p>

                <p>They are so easy going and popular making them a low-maintenance standard.  The showy variety of foliage color, texture and size offers a wide range of appearances in the garden. In mid-summer stems rise above the leaves bearing stalks of white or lavender, bell-shaped flowers.  Some varieties have a lovely fragrance.</p>

                <p>Clumps of this long lived perennial can be tiny or huge, grey-blue, green, or variegated and shade or sun tolerant. They can be planted in the ground or in containers (<em>Hosta elegans</em> is best avoided in containers). In containers large leaved types like more soil in the potting mix, while smaller leaved types like a soil-less mix.</p>

                <p><em>Hostas</em> pair beautifully with ornamental grasses, Hellebores, Bleeding heart and <em>Heuchera</em>.</p>

                <p>Here at Portland Nursery in spring we often have nearly 50 kinds of <em>hosta</em> in stock! The lists below offer a few of our favorites sorted by commonly asked for traits. How to find the perfect <em>hosta</em> fit for you? Check out the lists below or come on in! We would love to help you select a <em>hosta</em> that will add character, beauty, and fullness to your garden.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Hosta</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Agavaceae or Hostaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Hosta</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Hosta, also formerly called Funkia and Plantain lily.</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Japan, Eastern China and Korea</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Tolerant of a variety of conditions depending on cultivar. None of them like dark, dense shade. They enjoy protection from intense winds. In general Hosta prefer moist, well-drained, cool soil.</p>

                        <p>They prefer to be watered under the leaves via watering can or soaker hose in the morning. Usually, the more moisture available the more sun the plant can take. Blue-green leaves and white variegated leaves tent to do best in shaded places. Green to yellow leaved varieties tend to take more sun. Even the most sun tolerant varieties still prefer some shade.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance and propagation:</strong> So easy care! Slug baiting and weekly water in summer is about all you need to do to keep these beauties looking good.<br>
                        In the Portland area, plant <em>hostas</em> by October to give them enough time to settle their roots before cold weather sets in. They appreciate being lightly mulched in spring and autumn. Fertilizing is best done in spring to early summer.</p>

                        <p>They tend to multiply abundantly; dividing is not usually needed. Many people divide them in order to have more plants. Using two forks to pry large dug up clumps apart works well or you can divide by using a spade to remove a section of a clump in the ground. Dividing is best done in spring or in July/August (you will need to cut the foliage down if you choose to do it in summer). You can also divide in autumn in our area.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional qualities</strong>: Attracts hummingbirds and bees, cut flowers or leaves, tolerates moist soils. Drought tolerant once established.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> Slugs and snails are the biggest pest and make holes in the leaves. In rural areas deer sometimes snack on <em>hostas</em>.</p>
