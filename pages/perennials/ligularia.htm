                <p>With its bold dark foliage and eye catching yellow blooms, <em>Ligularia</em> is a prize specimen for any shade garden.</p>

                <p>A perfect foil for the silvery blues of Hostas or the feathery foliage of Astilbes, <em>Ligularia</em>s' heart shaped leaves range from deep green, bronze, or maroon, and from smooth edged, toothed, or serrated. Daisy shaped flowers, in hues of yellow not typical of most shade perennials, rise above the clumping foliage in mid to late summer.</p>

                <p>Planted in a row, <em>Ligularia</em> will create a striking seasonal hedge, and single plants become large focal points. These moisture loving plants are very well suited for placement besides pools, stream beds and in rain gardens.</p>

                <p><em>Ligularia</em> was first classified by count Alexandre de Cassioni in the early 19th century; it was first categorized under the Compositae family, but has since been reclassified under the Asteraceae family. <em>Ligularia</em> is native to China, Taiwan and Japan, and in Japan the plant is known as Metakaraku, which means "sweet smelling roots".</p>

                <p>Hybrid <em>Ligularia</em> have been bred with both foliage (like the  serrated leaves of L. 'Osirius Cafe Noir') and flowers (like the golden spires of L. 'The Rocket' - shown here) in mind.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: <em>Ligularia</em></h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asteraceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Ligularia</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> <em>Ligularia</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> China, Japan and Taiwan</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> A hardy perennial (USDA 8, 10-20 degrees), the <em>Ligularia</em> grows best in morning or late afternoon sun with midday shade; or dappled shade all day. Direct midday sun and intense heat can cause the foliage to wilt. <em>Ligularia</em> thrive in rich loamy soil, but can tolerate heavy clay soils once established. Ample moisture, however, is a non-negotiable for these water loving plants.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Follow a regular watering schedule during the first growing season to establish a deep, extensive root system. Feed with general purpose fertilizer before new growth begins in spring. To encourage more blossoms, prune old flower heads.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pest &amp; Diseases:</strong> Slugs and snails are often attracted to foliage. Common control methods include beer baited traps, diatomaceous earth, and iron phosphate based bates such as Sluggo. Leaf wilt is also a common problem for <em>Ligularia</em>. Foliage droops when exposed to direct, intense sunlight and during the heat of summer. Oftentimes the plant will revive in the evening when conditions are cooler. To avoid leaf wilt, plant <em>Ligularia</em> in a place that provides shelter from excessive heat and direct mid-day sun.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional qualities</strong>:  Attracts bees, butterflies, beneficial insects and hummingbirds.  Deer resistant.  Cut flower.  Loves moisture.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Dividing is the easiest route to propagate <em>Ligularia</em> and should be done in early spring or late summer. Dig up as much of the root system as possible, then using a sharp, clean knife cut the crowns into smaller sections and replant.</p>
