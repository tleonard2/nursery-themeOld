                <p>There are 68 species in the genus <em>Kniphofia</em>, all originating in southern and eastern Africa. They form clumps of grass-like finely toothed foliage with strong stems rising above the foliage with flowers that look-like glowing pokers or torches, hence the common name.</p>

                <p>The blossoms open from the bottom to top over the course of several days and change color as the blossoms mature. Most varieties begin blooming by late June and some will re-bloom until frost.</p>

                        <p>Hybridizing has led to many different colors and sizes of plants for the gardener to choose from. Flower color ranges from coral red through shades of orange, peach, yellow to near white and light green. Size ranges from dwarf plants 14 inches tall to large 6 feet tall plants. Some are evergreen and some deciduous dependent on the species.</p>

                        <p><em>Kniphofia</em> are a plant that can be used in the garden to make a statement, such as the 3 feet tall <em>Kniphofia</em> 'Apricot Soufflé', or used as a vertical accent in the perennial border. It is also has a unique structural look with the flowers stems rising above the foliage that would be a great addition to a tropical garden paired with purple or red-foliage cannas, or a more xeriscaped garden planted with <em>Perovskia</em>, <em>Echinacea</em>, and <em>Penstemon</em>.</p>

                        <p>Some of the smaller varieties also make nice additions to containers for summer bloom, and evergreen varieties give year-round interest. <em>Kniphofia</em> are attractive to hummingbirds and make a great addition to the hummingbird garden. They also make a great cut flower.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Kniphofia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asphodelaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Kniphofia</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Red Hot Poker, Torch Lily</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to southern and eastern Africa</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Plant in full sun with moist, humus-rich well-drained soil. In the summer, <em>Kniphofia</em> can handle moisture, but they need well-drained soil during the winter. Also, they need moisture when the blooms are forming and will fail to flower if conditions are too dry. <em>Kniphofia</em> can tolerate wind and are a good choice for coastal plantings.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Diligent deadheading (removing spent flower blossoms) will prolong the bloom season. In the fall, remove the unsightly looking leaves and any dead flower stalks that are left. For the winter, do not cut the foliage back, but instead try tying it up over the center of the plant to protect the crown from winter moisture and help insulate the crown to extend longevity. Mulching in the winter is helpful. In the spring, once all the cold weather is past, cut the foliage back down to about three inches from the ground to rejuvenate, but avoid pruning too close to the crown.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional features:</strong> Attracts hummingbirds, deer resistant, drought tolerant, cut flower, attracts bees and birds. &nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Dig up and divide clumps in the spring, unless it is flowering, in which case wait until after the plant is done flowering.</p>
