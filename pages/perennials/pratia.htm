                <p>Imagine creating a beautiful stone pathway, with a soft-textured green leaves and blue flowers growing in between the stones!</p>

                <p>Tolerant of heavy foot traffic, <em>Pratia</em> is a great choice for pathways and between stepping stones. The seed pods of <em>Pratia</em> attract birds and plants make a good lawn substitute.</p>

                <p>For those looking to add texture and color to rocky areas, <em>Pratia</em> also makes a good choice for growing over walls, in rock gardens, and in mixed containers. It makes an excellent living mulch; the dense soil cover it provides keeps out weeds. It’s also a good plant for erosion control. <em>Pratia</em> blooms repeatedly through the growing season and given the mild winters in Portland, it is also evergreen.</p>

                <p>One caveat: <em>Pratia</em> suffers in compacted soil, so amend compacted or clay soils appropriately before installing a pathway. <em>Pratia</em> also provides another option for perennially sought after blue flowers in the garden.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Pratia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Campanulaceae (formerly Lobeliaceae)</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Pratia</em> (Syn. Laurentia, Isotoma)</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Star Creeper (Blue, White, Super, Dark Blue)</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> New Zealand and Australia</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture</strong>: Keep curious children from eating it because all parts of the plant are poisonous. <em>Pratia</em> love moist, well drained soil. Plants will need water once every 7-14 days during the growing season. They will grow in sandy, silty, clay, or loamy soil. <em>Pratia</em> prefers full sun but will tolerate partial and light/open shade. An easy care and fast growing perennial, Pratia can spread up to 18” a year and get up to 4 inches tall. Both species are equally vigorous.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Apply fertilizer only when faster growth is desired.</p>

                        <p>For those trying to fill in large areas, <em>Pratia</em> may be propagated by division, seeds, or cuttings. Divide clumps in the spring or fall and replant immediately. Plant ripe seeds promptly in the fall. Seedlings need protection from frost for the first winter; plant in your garden after danger of frost has passed. To propagate by cuttings, in early summer, remove shoots with a generous amount of underground stem. Plant in individual pots and place in light shade until rooted. Plant in the garden the same summer or fall.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> <em>Pratia</em> is rarely bothered by pests and diseases. However, if the soil is too wet, this shallow rooted perennial can develop fungal diseases like root rot. Avoid planting in depressions where water may collect, and consider adding pumice at planting time in areas that may become compacted.</p>
