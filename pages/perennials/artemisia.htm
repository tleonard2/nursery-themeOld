                <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for graceful, easy-care plants to light up a sunny, dry area, look no further than <em>Artemisia.</em> The genus includes the ancient herbs Wormwood and Mugwort, the culinary herb Tarragon, and the plants known all over the desert West, sagebrush, are <em>Artemisia tridentata.</em></p>

                <p>Although definitely sun-loving plants, <em>Artemisias</em> are perfectly at home in a moon garden, where the silvery leaves catch the pale evening light. Wendy Johnson, in her book Gardening at the Dragon&rsquo;s Gate, evokes their subtle magic:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    &ldquo;All the <em>Artemisia</em> plants in the garden are under the dominion of Artemis, Greek goddess of the moon and of the hunt, and guardian of the sovereign chastity of those who choose to travel in her band of solitaries. The plants of Artemis all carry her unmistakable signature: finely cut silver foliage, acrid scent, and abidingly bitter taste. All light a path through the midnight copse, welcoming night hunters home to the garden.&rdquo;
                </blockquote>

                <p>Like their namesake, the solitary huntress of mythology, <em>Artemisias</em> prefer to be more or less left alone. As long as they are planted in a sunny spot with very well-draining soil, they require little from the gardener. A trim here and there in the summer to clean up rangy foliage and encourage a denser habit will keep them looking nice. Regular fertilizer is not necessary, but a drink of compost tea or fish emulsion once in the spring may be beneficial.</p>

                <p>The notable fragrance of <em>Artemisia</em> leaves range from delightfully sweet to pungent, to a camphor-like, medicinal odor. This is due to the presence of oils and compounds which have been used for centuries in various medicinal and herbal applications. Wormwood, for instance, was known as a vermifuge, flea repellant, and bittering agent, but also as a women&rsquo;s tonic and cure for sea-dragon bite (very important if you live in a maritime climate, as we do in the Pacific Northwest. Be wary of those sea dragons!).</p>

                <p>Artemisias blend well with many different kinds of sun-loving perennials or shrubs, but especially those with similar drought tolerance, such as coneflowers, rock rose, heathers, etc. They blend especially well with blue and white tones. Try adding a Silver mound or a White Mugwort to an area planted with bright blue Lithodora and pure white Dianthus or Baby&rsquo;s Breath for a lovely effect, especially at twilight.</p>

                <p>Often referred to as sages or sagebrush, <em>Artemisias</em> are not to be confused with true or herbal sages in the genus Salvia.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Artemisia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> <em>Asteraceae</em> (Daisy family)</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Artemisia</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Names:</strong> Depending on the variety, wormwood; mugwort; sagebrush</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> This very large genus is distributed widely throughout the world.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Artemisias</em> prefer full sun in very well-drained or sandy soil on the dry side.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Most ornamental <em>Artemisias</em> are herbaceous perennials that die back in the winter, but some are semi-evergreen. In this case, prune in early spring after new growth begins to remove dead material and to shape. Avoid cutting plants back to the ground or too severely, as this can stunt plants or even kill them. A light shearing, for all varieties, midseason helps keep plants compact and will encourage bushier, denser growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional qualities:</strong> Attracts butterflies, deer resistant. Many varieties have fragrant foliage. Good cut flowers. Drought tolerant.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> <em>Artemisias</em> are not often bothered by pests or diseases. Although aphids can colinize some species such as <em>Artemisia absinthium.</em> Rust or powdery mildew can occur, generally when plants are grown in heavy or water-retentive soils.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Most <em>Artemisias</em> are easily propagated from stem or root cuttings, and many from seed.</p>
