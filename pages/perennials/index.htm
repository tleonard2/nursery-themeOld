                <p>Perennials come back year after year, bringing seasonal color to your garden. They can add fragrance, attract wild life and create rhythmic change.</p>

                <p>Most perennials bloom for a two to three month period, with a handful of long season bloomers out there. Refer to our perennial bloom calendar to help you plan a year full of perennial color. Not only do perennials offer a wide array of flower colors and form but they can also add structure and texture with their foliage and growth habits. Tall, spiky Delphinium add spots of colorful vertical punctuation in a sunny boarder. Where as the robust leaves of <em>hostas</em> add a lush, dense feel. Whether you are planting containers or in the ground, there is sure to be a perennial or two to fit your garden's needs.</p>
