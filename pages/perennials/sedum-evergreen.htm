                <p>Sedums, or stonecrops, are easy to grow given good drainage and adequate sun. They are economical because they grow quickly, and are simple to propagate. Plus they are outstanding performers in containers, pathways, parking strips and much more.</p>

                <p>Their durability with drought conditions and shallow soil has helped them become the stars of green roof and living wall designs. Their range of foliage color and texture make them perfect plants for living art such as hanging pictures, wreaths and much more.</p>

                <p>If you want your creations to have year round interest it is nice choose varieties from the following list of creeping types, all of evergreen or semi-evergreen in Portland (USDA zone 8).</p>

                <p>Sedums are commonly called stonecrop because it is often found growing on and amongst stones. Whether it is a low-growing groundcover-type sedum or an upright shrubby-type sedum, they all have fleshy succulent leaves of various sizes, colors, and shapes, like full sun, good drainage, and are mostly drought-tolerant. Most bloom in the summer or fall with flowers of either yellow, white, or pink.</p>

                <p>Sedums work great in a rock or alpine garden or as a splash of interest in a rock wall. In a container, they could be great filler for that late season interest or as a cute little spiller for an extra surprise. It is hard to go wrong with a few cute sedums potted up in a container or basket. They are a favorite for green-roofs because they do not need a lot of soil and love those conditions.</p>

                <p>The flowers are great for attracting butterflies and bees and make a good cut flower. Planted with other drought-tolerant plants like grasses, coneflowers, asters, and penstemon one could have an easy care, attractive garden. There are also some varieties of native sedums that are very, very cool.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Sedum</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Crassulaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sedum</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin</strong>: Sedums come from the Northern hemisphere, with around 400 species coming mostly from mountainous areas.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun in well-draining, poor to moderate soil. Drought-tolerant but appreciates some water at flowering time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Shrubby-type sedums need to be cut down to the crown in the late fall once foliage starts to look bad, or in the spring if the seed heads are left for winter interest. The shrubby-types also might need staking if they are in too rich of soil. Creeping sedums benefit from having the flower heads cut back to maintain their shape. Easy!</p>

                        <p>Because of their diverse looks and sizes, they fit many roles in the garden or as container plants. Many groundcover varieties are evergreen or semi-evergreen while the taller sedums die back to the ground to re-emerge as cute rosettes in spring.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Easy to propagate from stem cuttings, sometimes detached leaves will even root and form new plants.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Snails and slugs can be a problem early in the season.</p>

                        <h2><em>Sedum spectabile</em><br />(Showy Sedum)</h2>

                        <p>There are many cultivars of this shrubby sedum originating from China and Korea. It grows about 18 inches tall and wide with upright or slightly spreading stems and roundish, 3 inch leaves and dies to the ground in the winter. In late summer and fall these plants are adorned with large domes of flowers in shades of pink about 6 inches wide that the bees and butterflies love. These might need staking if the flower-heads get too heavy. Zone 4.</p>
