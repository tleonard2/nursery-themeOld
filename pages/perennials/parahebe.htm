                <p><em>Parahebe</em> is a genus of some 30 species belonging to the foxglove or <em>Scrophulariaceae</em> family. The genus was given the name <em>Parahebe</em> because it looks similar to <em>hebes</em>, especially the leaves. </p>
	                <p>The leaves of <em>Parahebes</em> are on pliable wiry stems and are small, dark green and elliptical, often with toothed edges. The flowers are usually white, pink or mauve with contrasting veining. Flowers appear in late spring and summer and multiple flushes of blooms are possible. Most <em>Parahebes</em> are subshrubs (somewhere between a shrub and herbaceous perennial) and are evergreen or semi&ndash;evergreen in the Pacific Northwest. Thus, they can be added to your spring, summer, fall or winter garden.</p>

                <p><em>Parahebes</em> are largely native to New Zealand with a few species found in Australia and New Guinea. Because <em>Parahebes</em> are lax by nature, they are ideal for rock gardens, rock walls, front of borders, among dwarf shrubs or in mixed pots for sun or part shade. Their cheery and unusual foliage and flowers are fun additions to any nook of the garden. <em>Parahebes</em> also take well to pruning when they start to look tired or just after blooming.</p>

				<h2><em>Parahebe perfoliata</em></h2>

                <p>Each glaucous blue leaf on <em>Parahebe perfoliata</em> encircles the stem in an imitation of a miniature eucalyptus. Growing from a dense central core, stems reach up to three feet tall. In mid-summer spikes of violet blue flowers appear at the tips. This plant is upright in full sun and trailing in part shade and is an excellent choice for the front of a garden border.</p>

                <p><em>Parahebe perfoliata</em> appreciates well&ndash;drained soil with regular water and can be cut back hard in early spring to refresh it. This variety is hardy to Zone 7 and semi&ndash;evergreen in hard winters, but otherwise evergreen. Considered a Great Plant Pick for the Pacific Northwest.</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Parahebe</p>
                        <hr>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Scrophulariaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Australia and New Zealand</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Light, well-drained moist soil in a sheltered and warm location. Parahebes can tolerate part shade.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> <em>Parahebes</em> are semi-evergreen or evergreen. Leave old growth on during winter to protect the crown but cut back stems hard in early spring.</p>

                        <p>Also, cutting back flowers after the first bloom encourages a new flush of blooms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> <em>Parahebe</em> are susceptible to slugs and mildew.</p>
