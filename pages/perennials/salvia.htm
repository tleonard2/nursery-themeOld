                <p>Sages (<em>Salvia</em>) have been grown in gardens for a thousand years to make medicine and for use as culinary spice. The ancient Romans believed Sage sharpened the mind and imparted wisdom. In the Mediterranean, North Africa and later in Europe, it was thought to be a symbol of skill, long life, and good health.</p>

                <p>Now, two thousand years later not only do we still plant sage for practical uses in our gardens, but there are also now dozens of ornamental species available too!</p>

                <p>One of the upsides of globalization is that we now have access to a dizzying array of simply stunning salvias. The genus of Salvia is the largest in the <em>Lamiaceae</em> (or Mint) Family, and therefore has a wide array of flower color, foliage and growing habits. Salvias are often later season bloomers that can carry color in the garden until first frost. They can be used in a variety of settings such as containers (see our August 2007 Container Design), hanging baskets, drought tolerant areas and well tended garden beds.</p>

                <p>Salvias can be annual or perennial, sub-shrub or herbaceous, and evergreen or deciduous. Leaves are opposite and carried on square hairy stems and are often aromatic when crushed. Flowers are tubular with a split lower petal. They are a pollinator magnet, drawing bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies. They are also a low allergen plant, which makes them suitable for sensitive gardeners.</p>

                <p>There are so many we had to narrow down the list so here are a few of our favorites that are often available locally:</p>

In general plants grow to be 12&quot;-18&quot; tall by 12&quot; wide but there is a wide range depending on hybrid. Masses of concentric stacks of tubular flowers gives the plant compact, spiky look. Similar to those listed above, you will get a lot more action out of this plant if you deadhead the spent blossoms. Keep an eye out for slugs and aphids.</p>

                        <p>There are more than 20 cultivars of this species, however not all are common as grown bedding plants. The 'Sizzler' and the 'Salsa' are two common, fabulous series that are widely available.</p>

                <p>This species hybridizes with <em>S. microphylla</em> easily, so we can expect to see more cultivars of this appear as time goes on. Some of the many hybrids available now include; <strong>'Sierra San Antonio', 'Lipstick', 'Navajo Purple', 'Chiffon'</strong> and many more.

The erect, branching stems grow dark as they near the tips and terminate in a 8&rdquo; head of glowing vibrant blue-violet flowers that last until frost. Usually perennial, they need mulching to protect from winter cold and often die back to the ground in any case. Set out the slug bait around these guys.</p>

                <h2>Facts: Salvia</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> <em>Lamiaceae</em></p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Salvia</em> (sal-vee-yah)</p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Species dependent</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> 900 species from all around the world, except cold regions and tropical forests. Around half of the species are endemic to the Americas.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Nearly all species are full sun lovers and do best with at least 5 hours of sun daily. They can tolerate a variety of soil conditions but most have trouble in heavy wet soils, so amend the soil with compost at planting time here in the great Northwest.</p>

                <p>Well-drained, light, alkaline soils that are moisture retentive are ideal. Many species are not particularly long lived and may need to be replaced every 5 or so years.</p>

                <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> With proper drainage and enough sun, Salvias are remarkably care free. Slugs, snails, and caterpillars may be attracted to the foliage. Where soils are dry and air is humid, powdery mildew may occur.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> For both annual and perennial species, deadheading (removing spent flower heads as soon as they are done) will encourage new blooms and help keep the plant tidy. Prune in spring to remove damaged or unattractive stems. When pruning for health and shape, avoid pruning to bare wood as salvias tend to take great offense to this.</p>

                <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Seed of all species can be sown in spring (particularly successful with annual types). Softwood cuttings are best taken in early summer or any time during the growing season.</p>

                <p>Division of rhizomatous species can be done at almost any time, although moving or dividing plants during the heat of summer is best avoided.</p>
