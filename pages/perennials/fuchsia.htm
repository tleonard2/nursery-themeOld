                <p>These pendulous lovelies are represented in a genus of over 100 species of small shrubs. Their growing habits are categorized by being prostrate, trailing, upright lax (fountain), and upright. Leaves can be opposite, alternate, or whorled.</p>

                <p>Flowers are usually borne in clusters along the tips, are usually hanging and often are bi-colored. Flower color is often white, pink, red, or purple although greens, peaches and yellows are beginning to appear too. When talking about fuchsia flowers the terms sepal, tube, and corolla are often used. The sepal and tube are the exterior portions and the corolla is the interior. Spent flowers turn into an edible fruit which has been suggested to have the flavor of grape spiced with black pepper.</p>

                <p>Highlights of these beauties include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme easy care once established.</li>

                    <li>Attract humming birds like you wouldn't believe!</li>

                    <li>Long blooming June to frost.</li>

                    <li>There are over 2,000 cultivars to choose from!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Fuchsias are versatile and combine well with Hostas, bleeding heart, sweet box and ferns. They are also wonderful container plants either working solo or in a combination. A little known fact is most hardy fuchsias can tolerate full sun with some extra water.</p>

                <p>For the creme de la creme display of fuchsias, visit us in August when the <a href="https://www.nwfuchsiasociety.com/">Northwest Fuchsia Society</a> holds the annual Fuchsia show at our Stark location.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Fuchsia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Onagraceae Family (Evening Primrose Family)</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Fuchsia</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> South and Central America, with a few species from New Zealand and Tahiti.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Fuchsia enjoy fertile moist soil with good drainage. They grow in full sun, to partial and even full shade. Hardiness varies among varieties with <em>Fuchsia magellanica</em> being the most cold tolerant. A cold winter will knock even the hardy ones to the ground- although they will re-sprout the following spring. A heavy mulch with compost in the fall helps insulate tender varieties through the winter.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> Stressed plants may be prone to powdery mildew, aphids, whitefly, spider mites or thrips. In early spring slugs or root weevil may cause damage. If air circulation is poor, botrytis mold may occur in cooler months. Rust is a fungal disease with raised orange bumps.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> By seed, but more commonly by cuttings from new growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional qualities:</strong> Attracts bees, butterflies and hummingbirds.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Water regularly the first few years to establish plants. If you would like to create a bushier plant, pinch off the tips as it grows as this will encourage side shoots. Woody structure can be pruned in spring as new growth emerges to controll plant size and shape. Many varieties can grow into large shrubs if left unpruned.</p>
