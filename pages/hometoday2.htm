<div class="left"><p>At Portland Nursery we are grateful to have been deemed an essential business by the government and for the opportunity to provide jobs to those who need them. With this designation comes great responsibility, and we are taking it very seriously. We have implemented extensive social distancing measures to protect our staff and community.</p>
<p>Looking out for each other and making sure sick people stay home. We are requiring a doctor’s approval to return to work.
All these changes have taken a toll on the aesthetics of our beautiful nurseries, but we hope you’ll understand why we have taken these measures.
We hope you find solace in your garden.</p>
<h4>You can see all the measures we have taken and take advantage of our <a href="/about/plantpurchase/">"Curbside Pickup Ordering" here on this page.</a></h4>
