                        <p>What could be more satisfying and refreshing than growing your own herbs for tea? Just step out your back door, pluck a few leaves off your favorite herbs, and within minutes you can enjoy a fresh cup of tea. How self-sufficient!</p>

                        <p>We have compiled a list of herbs perfect for tea, and life in a container. Most of these plants require full sun and good drainage. There are some exceptions for light requirements. Group two or three plants with similar light requirements in a container for a nice combination. You can also mass a few pots of each herb together for a pleasing vignette.</p>

                        <h3>Making Tea</h3>

                        <p>For hot tea, pour boiling water over leaves and steep for a few minutes. Keep in mind to use only small amounts of your herbs for tea, large doses of some herbs may be harmful and extremely bitter. You can put your tea in the fridge for iced tea. Impress your friends by adding a mint leaf to each square of your ice cube tray. Fill the tray half way, add a leaf on top, and freeze. .</p>

                        <h3>Recommended Combinations</h3>

                        <p>Full, Hot Sun: Lavender, Pineapple sage, Scented geraniums, Aztec sweet herb, Lemon grass and Rosemary.</p>

                        <p>Partial Shade: Tea, Peppermint, Spearmint, Bee balm, and Wintergreen.</p>

                        <h3>Tips for Growing</h3>

                        <p>When to plant: These containers can be planted at any time the plants are available. If they are planted early in the season, they will have more time to fill out.</p>

                        <p>Water: In hot sun you will need to water every day or so. There are products available to help retain moisture that can help with reducing the need for frequent watering.</p>

                        <p>Fertilizer: You can mix a time release fertilizer (such as Osmocote), or a granular organic all-purpose fertilizer, with the potting soil. Another method is to fertilize once a month in the growing season with an all-purpose liquid fertilizer.</p>

                        <p>Pruning: Shrubby herbs such as lavender, rosemary and tea are pruned in late winter to early spring. This pruning helps keep the plants compact. Deciduous herbs such as peppermint or bee balm can be cut back to a few inches above the soil in winter.</p>

                        <p>Shelter: Tender perennials need additional shelter to make it through the winter. Pull containers into a sheltered area such as a porch or garage to ensure plant survival for the next season.</p>

                        <p>WARNING: Be aware of any chemicals that may have been applied to your herbs. Even organic products can be toxic.</p>

                        <p>If unsure it’s better to be safe. Harvest only untreated herbs for tea.</p>
