	   <p>Imagine harvesting fresh herbs from your garden all summer long! </p>
	            <p> <strong>Evergreen hardy herbs</strong> include bay, rosemary, garden sage, thyme, and winter savory. These herbs keep their leaves and can be harvested all year.</p>

<p> <strong>Hardy perennial herbs</strong> include chives, mint, marjoram, oregano, Roman chamomile, parsley (technically a biennial), and sorrel. These are deciduous perennials that naturally die back in winter outdoors. They can be kept from going dormant if they are grown inside all winter and given supplemental lighting. Outside they may keep their leaves if the weather is mild or if they are grown in a protected spot. They can be moved indoors in the winter, but do appreciate a winter rest, so if grown exclusively indoors they may be considered somewhat short-lived.</p>

<p> <strong>Annual herbs</strong> include basil, German chamomile, chervil, cilantro, dill, epazote, shiso, summer savory, and wheatgrass. Annuals usually complete their life cycles in the course of a single season, and will die sometime after setting seed.</p>

<p><strong>Tropical and tender herbs</strong> are comprised of lemongrass, lemon verbena, scented geraniums, stevia, and tarragon. Tropical herbs need constant moderate temperatures to do well.</p>

<p>You can buy small herb plants from the nursery, start seeds inside, or take cuttings of or make divisions from mature plants. Buying plants is the easiest way to start your herb garden. Portland Nursery usually has a good selection of evergreen herbs through the winter. Deciduous perennial herbs are generally available through early autumn. Annual and tropical herbs are generally available until late summer.</p>

<p>Then in the fall, we can help you get started on your indoor herb garden!</p>
