                <p><em>Lavandula x intermedia</em> is a hybrid lavender that is a cross of <em>Lavandula angustifolia</em> with <em>Lavandula latifolia</em>. These hybrids, frequently called LAVANDIN, originated as a natural cross and were initially developed in France as early as the 1820s for their heightened oil content. <em>Lavandula x intermedia</em> is quite a large shrub and one of the most fragrant. Counting its slender spikes of flowers, most reach a height of five feet tall and about eight feet wide. It is in full flower by mid-July and continues to flower well into autumn, even through a couple of frosts.</p>

                        <p>Cultivars between <em>Lavandula angustifolia</em> and <em>Lavandula latifolia</em> commonly called LAVANDIN. Long, mauve flower spikes, good for lavender wands. Broad foliage. One of the tallest lavenders. 3'X4'</tp>

                        <h2>Facts: Lavendula</h2>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Lavandula</em> from the Latin verb ‘lavare’ meaning ‘to wash’, reference to the use of water perfumed by oils of members of the genus.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Lavender</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> 30 species of small shrubs or herbs, native to France and the western Mediterranean. Lavender is cultivated worldwide for its volatile oils, fragrance, craft material, and is grown as a garden plant as far north as Norway.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> The basic requirements for successfully growing lavender are full sun and good drainage. Lavender is a hardy plant and will tolerate neglect, but it will flourish best if these two requirements are met.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> In general, lavender is a very hardy plant and the impact of disease is minimal. Due to poor drainage lavender plants may be subject to root rot. Additionally, windburn may affect some species. This will look similar to rust, but it is actually not fungal. The leaves will rejuvenate by the next spring.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Pruning is the best way to maintain healthy and vigorous bush. Pruning should be done at least once a year for the whole life of the plant. Cut back one third of the bush in early to mid-autumn, it will flower in spring and then again in late summer/autumn.</p>

                        <p><strong>Planting information:</strong> Lavenders generally transplant well but will usually not flower much during the first summer following transplanting. The best times to transplant are late autumn/early winter and very early spring.</p>

                        <p><strong>General Info:</strong> <em>Lavandula angustifolia:</em> English Lavender is the most common narrow-leafed variety. It grows to about 1 to 3 feet high and occasionally taller in gardens. This lavender has short, but irregular, crooked stems that are covered with a flakey yellowish grey bark. The flowers grow on short stemmed laterals with one to six flowers on the terminal end.</p>
