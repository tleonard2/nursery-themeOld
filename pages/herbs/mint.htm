               <p> Mint has a long history in cultivation.  In Greek mythology, a nymph named after the plant, Menthe or Minthe, is said to have been turned into the herb by Persephone.</p>
	               <p>In Western cuisine, mint is traditionally used in lamb dishes, beverages, and desserts.  Generally, mints are rich in carotenes and vitamin C as well as magnesium, copper, iron, potassium, and calcium.</p>
<p>What herb garden would be complete without mint?  Highly aromatic, with uses in the culinary arts, herbal medicine, and crafting, mints are among the easiest herbs to grow.  Use in summer drinks and teas, vegetable and fruit salads, or even with meat or savory dishes.  Make a fragrant summer wreath or bouquet!  Although it is rich in many volatile essential oils, it is menthol that is most recognizable as the “minty” smell.  Menthol has antiseptic, decongestant, and analgesic uses.  </p>
<p>Mint is a great plant for beginning gardeners and container gardeners.  In fact, growing mint in containers is advisable to prevent it from spreading to where it isn’t wanted.  On the flip side, mint makes a fast spreading groundcover that combines nicely with trees and shrubs.  If placed mindfully among plants of similar vigor, it can be the perfect plant in a mixed border.  </p>
<p>In general, mint flowers attract bees, butterflies, and beneficial insects.  Specifically, it is one of the insect food plants that supports populations of parasitic wasps.  It follows mustard and buckwheat in flowering time, so if you would like parasitic wasps to have food all summer, plant mustards and buckwheat also.   Parasitic wasps prey on caterpillar pests.  Mints bloom in summer and can be shades of white, pink, or lavender.  People interested in these insect pollinators and beneficial insects might alternate years of harvest among plants so that both gardeners and pollinators are both happy!</p>

                        <p>A variety with leaves that are toothed, wooly, and rounder than those of other mints, apple mint can grow up to three feet high.  This also makes it one of the tallest mints to grow.  The flavor of apple mint is fruitier and less “minty” than most mints, with distinct apple notes.  Its flavor shines brightest when used in fresh preparations like teas, cocktails, and sorbets.  However, it can also be used in pickling and making jam.  It is less aggressive than other mints but care should still be taken when planting it so it will not colonize where it is unwanted.  Often misnamed as <em>Mentha rotundifolia</em>.  Large spikes of lavender flowers.  USDA zones 5-11.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Mentha</h2>

						<p><strong>Family:</strong>  Lamiaceae</p>
						<p><strong>Genus:</strong>  Mentha</p>
						<p><strong>Common Name:</strong>  Mint</p>
						<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Widespread genus across the Northern and Southern hemispheres on continents Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America.</p>
						<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Mints require fertile, moist soil that is rich in organic matter, with a pH of 6 to 7.  They prefer sun to part shade.  In general, more sun increases the amount of aromatic essential oils that the plant produces.  A moist spot in your garden would be perfect.  However, mints can hybridize easily and spread vigorously (some say invasively) via underground stolons and by seed, so it’s advisable to grow them in a container or confined space and deadhead promptly.   </p>

						<p>To grow mint as a houseplant, plant in any good potting soil and fertilize monthly with a liquid fertilizer that has been diluted by half.  Place in bright light and consider supplemental light even if right near a window.  Keep the soil moist but don’t over water.  Yellowing leaves can be a sign of overwatering.  Plants can reach 1 to 2 feet.  They will stretch towards the light so turning the plant periodically can help keep the growth even.  Mints tolerate average indoor humidity an	d prefer temperatures between 60F and 75F.</p>

						<p><strong>Maintenance/Harvest:</strong>  Fertilize regularly to keep plants in optimum health, especially if they are harvested a lot.  Mulching is advisable to keep soil moist during the summer drought.  Regular pruning keeps plants bushy.  </p>
						<p>There are a couple ways to harvest mint.  One is to pick leaves as you need them.  If you are interested in drying them, however, cut whole stalks to within an inch of the soil right before flowering.  Essential oils are at their highest concentration in the leaves at this point.  Also, leaves of mints may turn bitter after flowering, so deadheading can help prolong the harvest period.  </p>

						<p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong>  West of the Cascades, mint often gets an orange fungus called rust. Remove affected stems, or cut back the whole plant and fertilize to stimulate new, rust free growth.  Allow adequate space between plants to prevent disease. Spittle bugs often use mint as a seasonal host in the spring, but they don’t harm the plant and will move on in a few weeks. </p>
