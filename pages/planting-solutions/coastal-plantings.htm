	            <p>This page will serve as a guideline for those inquiring about flora that will do well along the Pacific coast. Research into micro climates originated with conversations with nurseries in Lincoln City, Oregon.</p>

	            <p>The micro climates may vary from block to block or from one side of the lake to the other. A gardener at the Pacific coast will have alkaline soil closer to the ocean. With this type of soil one would need to add compost and possibly an acidifying amendment to balance pH. The further away from the beach, the less alkaline the soil will be.</p>

	            <p>It is strongly suggested you become acquainted with your own micro climates, as well as soil pH. A good starting point is to observe what plants your neighbors have in their gardens.</p>
