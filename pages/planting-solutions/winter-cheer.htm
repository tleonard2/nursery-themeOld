                <p>As the light levels fall and summer weather gets pushed farther and farther into memory, we wonder if our gardens and porches have to look so desolate. The answer is “No!” Celebrate the season with a holiday hanging basket!</p>

                <p>At Portland Nursery, we have all the supplies you need to create your own winter basket. Celebrate the season with the smell of conifers!</p>

                <h3 class="center">Gather your Supplies</h3>

                <p>Supplies needed: 1) Hanging baskets. Those left over from summer are fine. We tend to use iron baskets with coir fiber linings. 2) Potting soil. 3) Christmas greens, cut floral items, and any other decorations you would like to accent your basket with.</p>

                <p>A good design principle is to add the most structural and colorful items in odd numbers. Trim off leaves, needles, and branches from the base of your material so that it’s easier to position in the soil.</p>
