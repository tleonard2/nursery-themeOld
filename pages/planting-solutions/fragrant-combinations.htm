						<p>We have selected some of our favorite fragrant plants that are readily available putting them together to create beds with year-round interest. We have also tried to show small vignettes for tiny areas.</p>

						<p>In all the following combinations, specific plants can be replaced in order to tailor the design to your needs. Keep in mind that a substituted plant should want similar cultural conditions. All plants are subject to seasonal availability. We have tried to choose plants we commonly carry. Please ask for assistance if needed.</p>

						<h3>Tips for Establishing New Plantings</h3>

						<p><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong></p>
						<p>We recommend adding compost to the planting area to improve drainage and fertility. Mix in the compost at a ratio of 1/3 compost to 2/3 soil. If your soil is heavy clay you may also want to add pumice.</p>
						<p><strong>When to Plant:</strong></p>
						<p>Best planting times are midspring to early summer, and early fall. Mid-summer planting should be done in the cool parts of the day with ample water. Be aware of soil moisture to avoid compaction if planting late fall into winter.</p>
						<p><strong>Water:</strong></p>
						<p>New plants need regular water for the first two seasons to become established. In summer, water plants once a week, slowly, for an hour. Containers may need to be watered every other day depending on size and location. Frequency may be altered as the season changes.</p>
						<p><strong>Fertilizer:</strong></p>
						<p>Use an all purpose fertilizer of your choice applied in spring. Follow directions on the package for application rates. New transplants can be watered in with fish emulsion and/or kelp to alleviate shock. Regular applications of specific bloom fertilizers help keep annuals flowering all season.</p>
						<p><strong>Mulch:</strong></p>
						<p>We recommend mulching one or two times a year (spring and fall) with a fine compost. Mulching helps conserve water, improves soil texture and fertility, and insulates roots. Spring mulch can also be mixed with a granular all purpose fertilizer.</p>
