                <p>Design a simple plant palette with bold, architectural plants. For shade or sun, these plants complement any modern garden style.</p>

                <p>While many gardeners in the Pacific Northwest seek a complexity and style closer to that found in nature, there are other garden styles whose character is much simpler. Modern garden design, in particular, favors a limited plant palette and bold, architectural plants. A modern garden design using architectural plants (strong in shape and form) works well with mid-century homes and simple hardscaping materials<br>
                (e.g., concrete or metal).</p>

                <h3><em>Disporum cantoniese</em> &lsquo;Night Heron&rsquo;</h3>

                <p><em>Disporum cantoniese</em> &lsquo;Night Heron&rsquo; emerges in spring with dark mahogany stems that resemble bamboo. It tall slender form and shiny green summer leaves add a lot of structure.</p>

                <p>Height: 4-5 feet.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3><em>Athyrium niponicum</em></h3>

                <p>Japanese painted fern (available in a number of varieties) adds good color and texture.</p>

                <p>Height: 1.5-2 feet.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3><em>Ophiopogon planiscapus</em> &lsquo;Nigrescens&rsquo;</h3>

                <p>Black mondo grass is clean and modern in appearance and ties the combination together with its neutral color.</p>

                <p>Height: 1 foot.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3 class="center">Featured Sun Plants</h3><img src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/architectural/architecuralsun.jpg" alt="architecuralsun" class="img-responsive">

                <h3><em>Yucca filamentosa</em> &lsquo;Golden Sword&rsquo;</h3>

                <p>The <em>Yucca filamentosa</em> &lsquo;Golden Sword&rsquo; has wonderful structure and color making a great focal point in the garden, year-round.</p>

                <p>Height: 2-3 feet.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3><em>Sedum</em> &lsquo;Angelina,&rsquo;</h3>

                <h2>Special Considerations:</h2>

                <p>During the wintertime the <em>Disporum c.</em> &lsquo;Green Giant&rsquo; and <em>Athyrium niponicum</em> are dormant.</p>

                <p>They should be protected with mulch or compost once they go dormant in late fall. When the disporum breaks dormancy in spring it has a wild beanstalk-like growth, making it especially cool to watch.</p>

                <p>In the sun combination, <em>Eryngium</em> &rsquo;Big Blue&rsquo; dies back in the winter but the flower stalks of the dormant plant can be left alone for quite awhile because it looks nice dried in the garden.</p>

                <div class="treatment">
                    <h3>Care &amp; Maintenance:</h3>

                    <p>Provide well-drained soil and all-purpose fertilizer during planting time and annually, thereafter.</p>

                    <h3>Plant Spacing/Repetition</h3>

                    <p>Plants look most natural planted together in threes. This is a longstanding landscape design principle. Hence, when planting, group your three plants together.</p>

                    <p>Remember to account for their ultimate size and place the largest plant in the center.</p>

                    <p><em>Disporum&rsquo;s</em> height is 4-5 feet, while Athyrium&rsquo;s is 1.5-2 feet and <em>Ophiopogon&rsquo;s</em> is 1 foot. Yucca f. &lsquo;Golden Sword&rsquo; is 2 feet tall, while the flower stalk can be upwards of 6 feet.</p>

                    <p><em>Eryngium</em> &lsquo;Big Blue&rsquo; can reach 3 feet tall while Sedum &lsquo;Angelina&rsquo; is a groundcover.</p>

                    <p>If there is more room in the garden, the combination of three plants can be planted multiple times in a row or evenly spaced throughout a larger area.</p>
