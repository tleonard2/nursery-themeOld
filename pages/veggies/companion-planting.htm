                <p>An Introduction and Guide to Healthy Plant Relationships.</p>

                <p>Companion planting is a technique based on a long history of observations of the interaction between plants in the garden.</p>
				<p>Certain combinations of plants can add to, or detract from, the abundance and health of edibles in your garden by altering the soil, attracting or repelling insects or creating a helpful microclimate.</p>
				<p>Companion plants assist in the growth of others by attracting beneficial insects, repelling pests, or providing nutrients, shade, or support. They can be part of a biological pest control program.</p>

				<h2>How close do they need to be?</h2>
              <p>Plants that have known beneficial relationships (friends) should be planted within two or three rows of each other. </p>
               <p>Plants that are known to have detrimental relationships (foes) should be planted at least 2-3 rows apart.</p>
               <p>There are many neutral plants that can be used to fill space between friends and foes. So, just because two plants are not beneficial to each other doesn’t mean you can’t have both in your garden. </p>
