	            <h2>What can you do to help the Bees? Plant Cover Crops!</h2>
<p>A cover crop is a quick growing crop that is planted primarily to keep the soil covered for a short period of time, then plowed under as “green manure” or composted.</p>

<p>Most gardeners know about the benefits of adding organic matter to the soil. Many of us build the soil with annual applications of compost, manure, leaves, and grass clippings. Cover crops allow you to avoid importing soil amendments. By growing your own organic matter, you eliminate the fossil fuels needed to transport imported amendments, helping to make your yard a closed loop of energy inputs. (Ref: Edible Landscaping with Charlie Nardozzi: <a href="http://www.garden.org/ediblelandscaping/?page=september_cover" target="_blank">Fall Garden Cover Crops</a>)</p>

<p>With cover crops, large amounts of organic matter are added to the soil when the lush growth of green, mature crops is turned under. Organic matter improves soil texture as humus and stabilizes moisture content. The plant nutrients in these crops are returned to the soil, thus becoming a storehouse for nutrients.</p>

<p>Cover crops can provide a wonderful habitat for the pollinators that help keep your garden thriving. Flowering Cover crops such as crimson clover, buckwheat, alfalfa and mustard attract bees and beneficial insects that help with pollination and insect control in the garden. Cover crops encourage beneficial insects by providing flowers for a nectar source and foliage for shelter.</p>

			  <h2>Why plant a cover crop?</h2>
				<p>Large amounts of organic matter are  added to the soil when the lush growth of  green, mature crops  is turned under.  Organic matter improves soil texture as  humus and stabilizes moisture content.  The plant nutrients in these crops are  returned to the soil, thus becoming a  storehouse for nutrients. </p>

				<p>Legume  plants a re hosts to nitrogen - fixing bacteria which extract nitrogen from  the air and convert it into a form that can be  used by plants. When used as a cover crop,  legumes  return the nitrogen to the soil. </p>

				<p>Some cover crops, like oilseed radish and fava bean are deeply rooted. Their taproot is excellent at breaking apart clay, hard soils and providing much needed airspace. Cover crops planted in your garden will also serve as “living mulch” preventing erosion, nutrient loss from leaching and inhibiting weed growth.</p>

				<h2>How and when to seed garden cover crops</h2>
				<p>After your garden produce is  harvested, till the plant residue into the soil  where it will decompose to produce more  humus. This also prepares the soil for the  cover crop se ed. You may use either a drop  spreader, a broadcast spreader, or simply  broadcast the seed by hand.</p>

				<p>For more even  coverage, make two seeding passes over  the garden at right angles to each other.  Lightly rake the seed into the top ¼ inch  of soil. The seed m ust be covered and be  in firm contact with the soil for best  germination. </p>

				<p>If you seed before fall rains  begin, the seeded area should be watered  lightly to keep it moist until the seeds  germinate. Cover with compost for added  benefit.</p>

				<p>Recommended seeding rates: approximate number of square feet covered by 1 pound of seed: </p>
