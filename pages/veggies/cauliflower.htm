                <p>Fresh, clean and crisp cauliflower is akin to broccoli. It shares many of the same growing habits and culinary uses. An added bonus is that it can be roasted; a great way to bring out its creamy, nutty­sweet flavor.</p>

<h3>Site Requirements</h3>

<p>Cauliflower will want a fertile soil rich in compost, but not a lot of nitrogen. Place it in an open area and blanch when the curd begins to form to provide shade.</p>

<h3>Planting</h3>
<p>Transplant starts form March through June. Over-wintering types should go out between July and August. Space 2’ apart.</p>

<h3>Fertilizing</h3>

<p>Do not overfeed with nitrogen, but provide an organic fertilizer by tilling some into the soil before planting.</p>

<h3>Harvesting and Storage</h3>
<p>Heads are usually at maximum size when small amounts of space can be seen between the florets and a soft texture is noticed on the surface.</p>
<p>Examine heads for clean, pest-free storing quality and then store at around 35°.</p>
