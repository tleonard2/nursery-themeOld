                <p>Not only is swiss chard a good heat­of­the­summer spinach substitute, it’s also a looker! Check out varieties like ‘Bright Lights’ that have stunning, almost neon, color contrasts between leaves and stems.</p>

<h3>Site Requirements</h3>

<p>Chard is not particularly fussy but will always thrive in well-drained, fertile soil.</p>

<h3>Planting</h3>

<p>Plant out 2 weeks before last spring frost in a sunny situation. Give plants about 12” room between each other.</p>

<h3>Fertilizing</h3>

<p>Unnecessary, but an all-purpose should be sufficient.</p>

<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>Try to harvest only the outer leaves, so the inner core will keep producing. Pull from the base with a slight twist to make a clean break.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Treat chard as you would spinach, eating fresh, steamed, or freezing in plastic bags.</p>

 <h2>Varieties</h2>

<h3>Bright Lights</h3>
<p>Dark green foliage held up by brilliantly hued stems in neon colors ranging from pink to yellow, sometimes even striped. Mild flavor. Resembles a crisp spinach/lettuce. Matures in 1-2 months. Reaches a height of 20".</p>

<h3>Rhubarb Chard</h3>

<p>This one is a beautiful, rich scarlet red stemmed variety. Reaches a height of 20".</p>

<h3>Bright Yellow</h3>
	<p>Just the neon yellow stems which are a great contrast to the deep green foliage. Reaches a height of 20".</p>
