<p>We are passionate about growing food, and we strive to bring gardeners an expansive vegetable and herb selection along with expert advice to help you be successful.</p>

<p>We also carry a selection of medicinal herbs such as Marshmallow, and unusual edibles such as Malabar Spinach.  We are pleased to provide an equally large and diverse organic selection!.</p>

<p>For tomatoes, we carry the tried and true varieties such as Early Girl Tomato and Genovese Basil, a vast heirloom selection such as Moon and Stars Watermelon and Corno di Toro pepper, and unique selections such as ginger mint and red noodle beans.</p>

<p>Due to our broad selection, and the popularity of growing edibles, we do not have all varieties at one time.  Please call either location for current availability.</p>
