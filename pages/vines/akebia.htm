                <h3>Akebia Varieties:</h3>

                <p>There is just a handful of vines that thrive in shade, and Akebia is one of the best. We love it's dainty scented spring flowers and cute palmate leaves. It's super fast, so when the goal is to cover an unsightly view, Akebia is a good option. Akebias have the added bonus of producing fruit!</p>

                <p>Fruits are 3" long and lavender or blue in color. The edible portion is inside; a seedy treat that is covered in gelatinous goo! Two different varieties must be planted closely together in order to produce fruit.</p>

                <p>All Akebia vines are fast-growing to around 25-30', grow in sun or shade, and are hardy to Zone 5-6.</p>

                <h3>Varieties:</h3>

                        <h2>Facts: Akebia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Lardizabalaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Akebia &ndash; uh-KEE-bee-uh</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Chocolate Vine or Five-leaf Akebia</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Japan, Korea and China</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> A group of 4-5 species of vining plants.</p>

                        <p>Delicate-looking lightly scented flowers in pendulous clusters bloom in April. Male and female flowers are borne in the same cluster. Flowers have no real petals; instead their sepals look like petals and come in dusky purple, pink, pale yellow or white.</p>

                        <p>Leaves are palmate and are 2-5&quot; across. In mild winters leaves stay on the plant in winter, but most Portland winters cause defoliation.</p>

                        <p>Fruit is really interesting! Blue or pink pods are up to 5 inches long. Open them up and find a roll of white pulp full of black seeds. The pulp is described as 'tropical tasting' and is used to make jelly and juice. Plant two different varieties for fruit production.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Vines attach by twining and grow very fast, producing as much as 20 feet of new growth in a year. It should be maintained with yearly pruning and kept in place.</p>

                        <p>Grows 20-40' tall.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun, part shade or shade. Bounces back easily from pruning. Provide a sturdy trellis, arbor for the vine to climb on.</p>

                        <p>Hardy to Zone 5, -20f to -30f</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Akebia has become a naturalized weed in the eastern United States, but has not performed the same way in the west. Still, the plant should be kept in place with regular pruning.</p>

                        <p>Plants in the nursery are prone to problems with powdery mildew, but the disease is much less prevalent in a garden setting.</p>
