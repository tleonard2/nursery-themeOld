                <h2>Facts:Akebia</h2>


                <p class="clear"><strong>Family:</strong> Lardizabalaceae</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Genus:</strong> Akebia &ndash; uh-KEE-bee-uh</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Common:</strong> Chocolate Vine or Five-leaf Akebia</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Japan, Korea &amp; China</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Characteristics:</strong> A group of 4-5 species of vining plants.<br>
                Delicate-looking lightly scented flowers in pendulous clusters bloom in April. Male &amp; female flowers are borne in the same cluster. Flowers have no real petals; instead their sepals look like petals &amp; come in dusky purple, pink, pale yellow or white.</p>

                <p>Leaves are palmate &amp; are 2-5&quot; across. In mild winters leaves stay on the plant in winter, but most Portland winters cause defoliation.<br>
                Fruit is really interesting! Blue or pink pods are up to 5 inches long. Open them up &amp; find a roll of white pulp full of black seeds. The pulp is described as 'tropical tasting' and is used to make jelly &amp; juice. Plant two different varieties for fruit production.</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Size:</strong> Vines attach by twining and grow very fast, producing as much as 20 feet of new growth in a year. It should be maintained with yearly pruning &amp; kept in place.<br>
                Grows 20-40' tall.</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun, part shade or shade. Bounces back easily from pruning. Provide a sturdy trellis, arbor for the vine to climb on.<br>
                Hardy to Zone 5, -20f to -30f</p>

                <p class="clear"><strong>Problems:</strong> Akebia has become a naturalized weed in the eastern United States, but has not performed the same way in the west. Still, the plant should be kept in place with regular pruning.<br>
                Plants in the nursery are prone to problems with powdery mildew, but the disease is much less prevalent in a garden setting.</p>
