	            <p>An open, south or southwest facing slope with plenty of sun is an ideal site for a rock garden.</p>
<p>When planting a rock garden be sure to amend your soil to ensure good drainage. A good blend is 1/3 compost, 1/3 native soil, and 1/3 pumice added to create a loose, well draining mix.</p>

<p>For the first year deep watering is essential, especially on hot days. The second year water only when temperatures are above 75 degrees. The third year there should be no need to water because plants should have a well established, deep root system which will help them be drought tolerant.</p>

<p>If your design includes mounds or hilling be aware that these areas will dry out faster.</p>

<p>Most rock garden plants don’t need fertilizer. Over the years the best thing to do is to refresh the soil around the plants with a top dressing of compost.</p>

<p>The most successful gardens are those where the plants grown are naturally suited or adaptable to the conditions of the soil, situation, and climate. Native plants are an excellent place to start.</p>

<p>If you pick mostly evergreen, drought tolerant plants you will have little or no maintenance except weeding. Covering the soil with 1-2” of gravel or crushed stone will reduce weeding dramatically.</p>

		<p>Rock gardens by design imitate native land- scapes that grow in natural stone outcroppings, such as those found in an alpine meadow. Contemporary rock gardens are less strict about plant selection, being more a matter of using rocks, plants, and boulders in a naturalistic garden style. </p>

		<p>This is also known as a rockery. Rock gardens mostly include low growing perennials or shrubs with a mounding habit. These plants effectively resist wind and snow at high elevation. But there is great diversity in rock garden plants, not only as regards to shape, but also bloom time and color. Many alpine or high altitude plants will do well in a rockery.</p>

		<p>A rock garden can be ideal for Northwest gardeners who don’t have a lot of time. Once the rock garden is established there is little or no maintenance except some light weeding. They also can be as big or as small as you want. If garden space is not available, rock gardens can also be made in pots or troughs. The plants which can be grown in a rock garden are almost innumerable.</p></div>
