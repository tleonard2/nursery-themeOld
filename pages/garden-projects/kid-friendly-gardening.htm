                  <p>Gardening with children can be one of the most rewarding experiences for both the child and their parents or mentors. Children are natural gardeners - they are curious, learn by doing, and love to play in the dirt.</p>

				   <p>Working together in the garden can provide hours of quality time each week and encourages a child’s interest in the workings of nature and science, experiencing the cycles of life first hand. Giving a child their own space teaches responsibility and allows for creativity and a sense of pride in producing food or growing a bounty of wildflowers. As an added bonus, the whole family ends up with fresh food and a new appreciation of vegetables.</p>

	<p>Vegetable gardening can be especially rewarding for younger children. A lot of vegetable seeds are larger and easier for small hands to handle; they usually germinate in a shorter time and produce edible results within a single season. They can also be grown in pots if there is not yard space available. There are many varieties of vegetables developed especially for pots or small spaces. April is a good month for a visit to the garden center – everything you need for seed starting is in along with staff to help with all your questions.</p>

                <h3>Tips for Gardening with Children</h3>

				<ul>
				<li>Give them their own space - either raised beds, pots, or ground plots- make sure each child has their own space.</li>
				<li>Keep it small - a smaller space is more manageable and everything seems larger through a child’s eyes. Start small and increase with age and interest.</li>
				<li>Placement in the best possible spot - near the action, in the best sun and (prepared) soil, will optimize success.</li>
				<li>Use serious tools and work gloves - cheap plastic tools break and frustrate the new gardener.</li>
				<li>Engage kids in the entire process from seed to table.</li>
				</ul>
