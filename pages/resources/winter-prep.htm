                <p>Brrrrr! Cold winds and a chance of snow!</p>

                <p>Here are a few things you can do to protect your garden in winter weather.</p>

	                   <h2>Don't forget to water!</h2>

                <p>Moist roots are much more durable in cold weather than dry roots!</p>

				<p>Often our coldest weather around here comes with dry air and clear skies, sometimes with high winds. Make sure the soil around your plants is moist during these times. Moist soil is a better insulator than dry soil. Even if the water in the soil freezes, it is still better off moist. Plants that are in portable containers can and should be protected during hard freezes. This might mean moving temporarily to garages, sheds, or up against the house. This should not mean in the house in warm air; that would be very shocking to the plants.</p>

                <p>Before the cold weather settles in, lay mulch in the garden, if you haven&rsquo;t already. A layer of composted garden mulch or bark helps to protect the shallow roots in soil from being damaged by freezing air temperatures. It acts something like a blanket to trap some of the heat in the soil, keeping the soil temperature above freezing even when the air temperatures are temporarily below it.</p>

                    <p>Please note that neither soil nor plants actually make body heat as we do, so the blanket effect is only to trap existing heat, not continue to make and hold heat the way we do in our beds. It is alright for the mulch to partially cover most perennials but it should not bury the wooden stems of trees or shrubs. During extended cold snaps the soil can still freeze, but there is little you can do about this or the possible damage that can happen to plants. Keep in mind that deeply rooted plants such as established trees and shrubs should have no problems with this; it is never cold enough for long enough here to truly freeze the earth like in the tundra.</p>

                <h2>Prepare for heavy snow, ice and winter winds</h2>

                <p>Heavy snow or ice can cause branches on some conifers like Arborvitae and Junipers to bend down under the weight, or to splay. To avoid this problem, tie twine in a spiral shape, like a candy cane, around the length of the tree before snows arrive. This will support branches during damaging weather. Twine should be removed in spring when danger of harsh weather passes.</p>

                <p>Cold winds are our biggest foe in winter. Wind desiccates needles and branches, sapping moisture. The hardiest of plants can sustain winter wind damage. Apply <a href="http://www.bonideproducts.com/products/category.php?category_id=8&amp;page=5&amp;per=6" style="color: #511E2D; font-weight: bold;">Wilt-Stop</a> to newly planted evergreen plants to help keep leaves and needles moist during drying winter winds.</p>

                <h2>Plants in Containers</h2>

                <p>Bring tender plants indoors – Plants that are in pots and are considered to be tender should be be checked for hitchhiking insects and brought into a cool room of the house, like a garage, for the duration of the most extreme temperatures. Citrus, Cactus, Gardenias, Bougainvillea and tropical Jasmines are all in this category.</p>

                <p>Move containers up close the house, preferably in a spot that is protected from cold winds. Make sure your geraniums, fuchsias and other tender plants are tucked away for winter.</p>

                <p>Insulate pots. Many products can be used for insulation. Portland Nursery sells frost blankets and burlap for wrapping containers. Using old sheets or blankets will work fine too, but avoid using plastic to cover plants since moisture and air circulation is important. Adding straw or leaves under frost blankets will increase protection.</p>

                <h2>Plants in the Ground!</h2>

                <p>Plants are warmer in the ground than they are in containers. It’s a good idea to increase warmth for anything that is on the border of hardiness by adding mulch and covering plants with frost blanket, burlap or old sheets. <em>Hebes</em>, New Zealand Flax (<em>Phormium</em>), Camellias, Star Jasmine are all in this category.</p>

                <p>Some people like to cover or wrap their plants during cold snaps. This is fine and can temporarily trap a little bit of heat, but the key word is temporarily. Again, the plant is not making body heat to replace any lost heat. It does have the advantage of keeping some of the wind off of the plant, reducing damage from wind chill. Covers and wraps should be temporary and should not be used during our ordinary chilly, drizzly winter weather. They can trap moisture on the plant and can encourage rot.</p>

                <p>We stock frost blankets in 5x50’, 5x25’ as well as 12’ wide in bulk to help protect plants during severe weather conditions. It is permeable and reusable.</p>

                <p>Roses and other plants that may be overgrown can be partially cut back now. This is primarily to keep the plants from whipping around in the winter wind. In the case of roses, the actual pruning should be done in February before new growth starts. Some trees and shrubs like to be cut back now, and some prefer late winter (and for some, either is fine). If you have particular questions about your plant type feel free to contact us.</p>

                <p>Kale, chard, onions, garlic and shallots are fine if left uncovered. Lettuce and other greens, broccoli, cabbages should be harvested or protected with row covers, frost blankets or cold frames.</p>

	                    <h2>Hardy Bananas</h2>

                    <p>Hardy bananas are one that people are often not sure what to do with. The leaves will turn to mush at the first hard frost; there isn&rsquo;t really any getting around this. You should mulch around the plant to protect the roots, but they should survive without too much trouble or work. </p>
	                    <p>The tricky part is getting the stalks to live through the winter and grow to their full potential, which can take 2-3 years. Some people wrap the stalk with burlap. I believe that this only helps with the wind chill and should only be done during especially cold weather. In moderate weather it can trap moisture and encourage rot.</p>

                    <p>One thing that some people do is to put a black plastic bag over the tip of the stalk and cinch it onto the stalk. The purpose here is to keep excess rainfall out of the growing point. It should be done when the growing tip is dry. Understand that the growing tip of a banana plant acts like a small cup and can hold moisture. Constant moisture there with moderate temperatures can mean a rotten tip and therefore a ruined stalk. </p>
	                    <p>Keeping the tip dry for the coldest, rainiest part of winter might help prevent rot. Note that the wrap should only be on for a couple of months when it is coldest, say in December and January. It should not be there in late winter when the plant might try to start growing. Also, do not use clear or white plastic, or anything see-through. This can cause the greenhouse effect and make the growing tip very warm.</p>

	                     <h2>Fountains</h2>

                <p>Fountains should be drained and the pumps should be unplugged.</p>

                <h2>Worm Bins</h2>

                <p>Proud owners of worm bins should protect the worms for winter by bringing bins to an unheated area of the house like the garage.</p>
