                    <p>"Guests continually comment on the beautiful colors and variety of texture that they all enjoy so much. It's so nice to have bright gold, red and orange colors giving some sparks of cheer to a gray day. And, the birds seem to be loving it as well as there are more around than ever before, including lots of humming birds, juncos, chickadees and towhees that are still hanging around.</p>

                    <p>"Thanks for sharing your talents and helping us make our back yard a beautiful and peaceful place."</p>
