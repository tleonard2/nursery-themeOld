And, the birds seem to be loving it as well as there are more around than ever before, including lots of humming birds, juncos, chickadees and towhees that are still hanging around.</p>

                <p>"Thanks for sharing your talents and helping us make our back yard a beautiful and peaceful place."</p>

<ol>
<li>With a tape measure, locate the boundaries of your site  and sketch them on graph paper.</li>
<li>Indicate which way is north on your paper.</li>
<li>For a small space, 1/4 inch on paper equals 1 foot in the garden.</li>
<li>For a large space, set 1/8 inch equal to one foot.</li>
<li>Measure structures and plants you wish to keep, utility boxes, hose spigots, and windows, noting their sill height from the ground.</li>
<li>Mark areas that are particularly soggy, dry, sunny, shady,  or have poor soil conditions.</li>
<li>Indicate views to keep and those to block </li></ol></div><!-- treatment -->
