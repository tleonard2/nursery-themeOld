			<p>We’re hot here at the nursery and we're sure you are too. Here are some important tips we wanted you to have.</p>

			<p>Our biggest concern in a heatwave is with the watering of new plantings. The best approach is to water deeply, on a low setting for 45 minutes or so — soaker hoses work best.</p>

			<p>Containers may need to be watered more than once a day. Also, if plants are wilting but have been watered, it may be due to warm air temperatures — no need to re-water.</p>

			<p>Adding three inches of mulch will help tremendously with moisture retention in the soil. Read through our <a href="/garden-projects/mulching">Mulching page</a> for some great tips.</p>

			<h2>Our Watering Tips:</h2>

			<ol class="tiplist">
                        <li><strong>Wilting does not always mean thirsty &ndash;</strong> Some plants like Rhododendrons will curl their leaves during high temperatures to conserve moisture. If the ground is moist and they still do this, you can use a product like <strong>Bonide Wilt Stop</strong> to cut down on moisture loss from the leaves. Apply early in the morning, or later in the evening.</li>

                        <li><strong>Soaker hoses use less water! &ndash;</strong> Overhead sprinklers lose a lot of water to evaporation &ndash; using soaker hoses saves water and helps with deeper watering.</li>

                        <li><strong>Even and consistent watering helps prevent blossom end-rot in tomatoes &ndash; </strong>Again, watering from below and at the same intervals (every other day in this weather is good) will help, but if you see blossom end-rot forming on your tomatoes use a product like <strong>Bonide&rsquo;s Blossom End Rot</strong> to give them a quickly available dose of lime.</li>

                        <li><strong>Nematodes hate dry heat &ndash; </strong>Wait until the temperatures get back down to the mid to upper 80&rsquo;s to apply nematodes, and make sure the area is well watered first before applying.</li>

                        <li><strong>New plantings also hate dry heat &ndash; </strong>We recommend waiting until the temperatures drop a bit before adding new plants to your garden as well. You can hold them in a shaded area for a week or so, just make sure they are kept watered.</li>

                        <li><strong>Freshen up those pots! &ndash;</strong>If replanting your pots, don&rsquo;t forget to use <strong>Sure-Start</strong> for water retention and the mycorrhizae that will help your plants take up nutrients. Water containers once or twice a day as needed.</li>

                        <li><strong>Maxicrop</strong> for a quick boost &ndash; Our staff likes to use products like <strong>Maxicrop</strong> as a transplant solution to give new plantings (and existing ones) a boost without the danger of burning new roots.</li>

                        <li><strong>Wetting wilting foliage in the heat and sun can scorch! &ndash; </strong>Water from below if possible, or when the sun is off them - like early in the morning, or later in the day.</li>

                        <li><strong>Even established plantings need water in these temps. &ndash; </strong>But hold off on fertilizing until things cool down a bit, or use an organic form of fertilize that will slow release.</li>

                        <li><strong>Check labels &ndash;</strong>Most pesticides and fungicides have warnings on their labels about use during high temperatures. Check before spraying to prevent any damage.</li>

                        <li><strong></strong>Take a break in the shade with some ice tea to hydrate yourself as well and enjoy your garden &ndash; it&rsquo;s Portland after all, and the heat won&rsquo;t last long! (Or will it this year?)</li>

					<h4>Tips from the <a href="https://www.regionalh2o.org/" target="_blank">Regional Water Providers Consortium</a></h4>

					<p>Lawns certainly have their benefits, but they can also be water hogs, gulping down two to three times more water than other plants in the yard. A lot of water – between 30 and 50 percent – used to irrigate lawns is also often lost to evaporation, run-off, water from sprinklers hitting the sidewalk and street instead of the lawn, and over-watering.</p>
					<p>The <a href="https://www.regionalh2o.org/" target="_blank">Regional Water Providers Consortium</a> offers these tips to help you weigh alternatives for replacing all or part of your turf lawn with other plants that require less maintenance and water.</p>
					<p><strong>1. Replace lawn with alternative seed mixes</strong><br />
						Alternative lawn seed mixes contain low-growing, drought-tolerant plant varieties that require less mowing and irrigation once established. Sometimes called “ecolawns,” these mixes combine grasses with a variety of other plants and flowers. For example, perennial ryegrass mixed with strawberry clover yarrow, English lawn daisy, Baby-blue-eyes and Roman chamomile creates a green, white, pink, and blue carpet of plant material. Micro-clover lawn is another variety. It is dark green, thick and feels good on bare feet. In the hot, dry summer months these types of alternative lawns may only need about one inch of water per month, compared to the one inch of water needed weekly by turf grass lawns. You can mow the alternative lawn about once a month to maintain a height of about three to six inches.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Plant ground covers</strong><br />
						ground covers come in a variety of textures and colors – some even have flowers and berries. ground cover varieties, such as Woolly Thyme, are often called “Stepables.” These are great for planting in parking strips, between stepping stones and on paths. They feel good to walk on and don’t need to be mowed.</p>
					<p><strong>3. Choose shrubs and trees</strong><br />
						Many homeowners are taking out their parking strip lawns and planting shrubs and trees, which add structure and definition to a landscape and invite birds into your yard. Once established, they generally require much less water than a lawn, and once established, don’t need much, if any, supplemental watering.</p>
