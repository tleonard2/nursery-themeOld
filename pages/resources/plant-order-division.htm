	           <p>We have shut down our Curbside Ordering System for a much needed update. All orders placed before Monday, January 11 will be fulfilled at our SE Division location.</p>

<p>We are expecting the system to be down for several weeks. During that time, we will be accepting orders over the phone for pickup at both locations.</p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience, and are looking forward to seeing you all as you prep for the spring!</p>
