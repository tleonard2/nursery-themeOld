                <p>We are wild about roses! There’s nothing quite like stuffing one’s nose into a big dewy rose bloom and taking a long sniff! That’s why we always offer a huge selection of old-fashioned favorites and new additions every spring.</p>

                <p>Our bare root roses arrive in February, and our potting crews get right to work planting them in containers. All are sold in pots, rather than bare-root, which protects their roots from breaking and drying out. Rose flowers are hard to resist, so when they bloom, our selection fades. Please call in advance to find current availability.</p>

                <p>You can find our best selection of roses in March and early April when our potting process is complete.</p>

                <p>Our rose buyer carefully selects the best varieties based on color, fragrance, and disease resistance. You'll find all the roses we plan to bring in this spring in our handy Rose Lists.</p>

                <h2>Rose Classifications</h2>

                <p>Roses come in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colors, and placing them in classes helps us organize roses that have similar characteristics. The American Rose Society resets classification schemes from time to time, adjusting to new developments in roses.</p>

                      <p>We are really excited to partner with the Portland Rose Festival Foundation to offer the Official Rose of the 2020 Festival: Princess Power!</p>

<p>This Hybrid Tea has well-formed formal double flowers that sit atop long stems perfect for adding to bouquets. Petals appear to be hand-painted pink, with a cream reverse and exude a light fruity scent. Lush foliage is a dark glossy green and disease resistance is good!</p>

<p>Portland Nursery is the exclusive provider of ‘Princess Power’. It will be available at both of our stores beginning in February of 2020.</p>

<p>For every Princess Power rose purchased, Portland Nursery will donate $2.00 to the Portland Rose Festival Foundation.</p>

                           <h3>Sun</h3>

                        <p>At least 6 hours a day. Attempting roses with less sun is an uphill (and generally losing) battle.</p>

                        <h3>Space</h3>

                        <p>Good air circulation is essential to keeping disease at bay. Plant roses at least 3 feet from other plants. Prune out branches that grow toward the inside of the plant.</p>

                        <h3>Food</h3>

                        <p>Roses will perform best (lots of flowers &amp; limited disease) if they are fertilized. Choose a fertilizer that is labeled for use on roses. Whether the food is organic or synthetic, liquid or granular, follow the directions on the package exactly.</p>

                        <h3>Water</h3>

                        <p>Water in the morning so leaves can dry (on sunny days) before night-time. Use enough water to soak the roots completely, but do it just once a week for established plants. If temperatures are very hot, water more often.</p>

                                 <h3>Want your roses to be better than ever? Here are some helpful tips to keep the flowers coming all season.</h3>


								<ul>
								<li>Deadhead your roses. Plants that are allowed to set seeds are less likely to continue blooming, so remove spent flowers. Make cuts just above the first set of five leaves that faces out, away from the center of the plant.</li>
								<li>Prune out branches that grow toward the center of the plant to allow for good air flow.</li>
								<li>Fertilize after the first flush of flowers if finished, and follow the directions on your fertilizer of choice.</li>
								<li>Monitor for diseases. Black spot, rust and powdery mildew proliferate in temperate humid weather, so be on the lookout for these rose nemeses! Pick off leaves at the first sign of infiltration!</li>
								<li>Spray for diseases if needed. Serenade is an OMRI listed fungicide with a bacteria as the active ingredient that is listed for treatment of black spot, powdery mildew and rust. It will not remove what is present, but it can prevent further damage.</li>
								<li>Aphids will arrive soon if they haven’t already. Ladybugs are a great insecticide, as are little birds, and often a strong stream of water is enough to knock aphids to the ground. If you choose to spray, insecticidal soap should be sufficient.</li>
								<li>Mulch the ground under roses. Mulch covers existing spores to prevent them from splashing onto lower leaves, helps to prevent weeds and keeps soil wetter in summer and drier in winter.</li>
								<li>Water roses in the morning, and try to keep leaves dry. Soaker hoses are your allies in the quest to keep roses looking lush.</li>
								</ul>

	                                        <p>Roses can be moved in autumn without too much trouble. They should be moved later in autumn, the middle to late part of October or the first part of November. More precisely, it is best done once the season has definitely cooled off but before it has rained so much that the soil will be saturated. Before digging up the rose, have the new site prepared. This means get the soil loosened and mixed with compost.</p>

                        <p>It would not hurt to add a bit of bone meal or organic granular transplanting fertilizer, but quick acting fertilizers are not recommended for this. Cut the rose bush back to about 18 inches tall, pruning as you otherwise would in February. Then dig up the plant, keeping as much of an intact root ball as you can manage. Move the plant promptly to the new spot, making sure the soil level as it relates to the bush stays the same; don&rsquo;t bury the stem.</p>

                        <p>Water it in afterwards to settle the soil, and apply a thin layer of mulch; again, don&rsquo;t bury the stem. The plant shouldn&rsquo;t need further care until spring growth starts.</p>

                        <p>Some shrubs handle this sort of treatment better than others. Roses, butterfly bushes, Hydrangeas, and willows survive transplant fairly easily. Established large shrubs such as Viburnum or Hibiscus syriacus have a harder time. Established conifers often transplant poorly and don&rsquo;t have a particularly high survival rating. Part of the trick is to get an intact root ball of sufficient size for the shrub. Dwarf plants often move easier than their larger counterparts.</p>

                                        <p>A customer asks:</p>
	                                        <p><em>&ldquo;My roses are starting to develop disease, with black splotching on the leaves. What to do?&rdquo;</em></p>

                        <p>This one is familiar to most experienced rose growers. It is one of several diseases that affect roses, and is usually called black spot (Diplocarpon rosae). As shown above, the leaves develop black blotches and the surrounding tissue turns yellow. The disease can cause significant defoliation and reduces the vigor of the plants, and can eventually kill them.</p>

                        <p>Cultural treatment is your best defense for this. This means picking infected leaves off the plant, removing fallen, infected matter under the plant, providing adequate air circulation and plenty of direct sunlight, and keeping the leaves dry when watering the plant. Overhead sprinklers are a big &lsquo;no-no&rsquo; with roses.</p>

                        <p>Try spreading the frequency of watering out as far as possible between deep soakings. Also, be careful of companion plants requiring more water than roses like. Some roses are more susceptible to disease than others, with wild and shrub roses showing much better resistance than most floral hybrids (hybrid teas, grandifloras, etc.).</p>

                        <p>Fungicidal sprays can also be used to help control the spread of this disease, but <em>do not kill it off entirely</em>. We sell several sprays that can help, including copper soap, flowable sulfur (don&rsquo;t confuse these two with the dormant sprays) and Fung-onil.</p>

									      <p>Another of those leaf diseases that rose growers are familiar with is popping up its head now. Commonly called rust, there are a number of diseases that all look similar and have similar consequences. Rose rust (Phragmidium sp.) is common and many perennials in the mallow family (especially hollyhock, but also Mallow and <em>Lavatera</em>) get the undersides of the leaves affected by their version of this disease (Puccinia malvacearum).</p>

                        <p>These diseases can cover leaves and drain the plant&rsquo;s energy, and can cause leaf loss when heavily infected. Fungicides such as Immunox and&nbsp; sulfur can lessen the damage, and it is a good cultural practice to remove heavily infested leaves and avoid wetting the leaves.</p>
