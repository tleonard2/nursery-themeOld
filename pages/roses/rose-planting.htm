                <p>Planting a Bare Root Rose</p>

				<p>Space roses 3' apart for average size (3-6' tall) roses; 5' apart for roses that sucker or ramble.</p>

				<p>Dig a hole 18" x 18". If soil is dry, fill the hole with water and allow to drain.</p>

				<p>Add compost (roses love mushroom compost) to the soil that was taken from the hole. The mix should be 1 part compost to 2 parts soil. Add bone meal or an organic rose food to the mix as well. Read the label for amounts. Use the mix to build a mound of soil in the middle of the hole.</p>

				<p>Place the plant above the mound so the bud union (swelling at the base of the stem) is above or at ground level.</p>

				<p>Fill the hole 2/3 full with the compost and soil mix. Lightly tap the soil to remove air pockets. Fill in with remaining soil so that soil level is level around the base of the rose.</p>

				<p>Water thoroughly and slowly.</p>

                           <h3>Sun</h3>

                        <p>At least 6 hours a day. Attempting roses with less sun is an uphill (and generally losing) battle.</p>

                        <h3>Space</h3>

                        <p>Good air circulation is essential to keeping disease at bay. Plant roses at least 3 feet from other plants. Prune out branches that grow toward the inside of the plant.</p>

                        <h3>Food</h3>

                        <p>Roses will perform best (lots of flowers &amp; limited disease) if they are fertilized. Choose a fertilizer that is labeled for use on roses. Whether the food is organic or synthetic, liquid or granular, follow the directions on the package exactly.</p>

                        <h3>Water</h3>

                        <p>Water in the morning so leaves can dry (on sunny days) before night-time. Use enough water to soak the roots completely, but do it just once a week for established plants. If temperatures are very hot, water more often.</p>

	                              <p>Roses can be moved in autumn without too much trouble. They should be moved later in autumn, the middle to late part of October or the first part of November. More precisely, it is best done once the season has definitely cooled off but before it has rained so much that the soil will be saturated. Before digging up the rose, have the new site prepared. This means get the soil loosened and mixed with compost.</p>

                        <p>It would not hurt to add a bit of bone meal or organic granular transplanting fertilizer, but quick acting fertilizers are not recommended for this. Cut the rose bush back to about 18 inches tall, pruning as you otherwise would in February. Then dig up the plant, keeping as much of an intact root ball as you can manage. Move the plant promptly to the new spot, making sure the soil level as it relates to the bush stays the same; don&rsquo;t bury the stem.</p>

                        <p>Water it in afterwards to settle the soil, and apply a thin layer of mulch; again, don&rsquo;t bury the stem. The plant shouldn&rsquo;t need further care until spring growth starts.</p>

                        <p>Some shrubs handle this sort of treatment better than others. Roses, butterfly bushes, Hydrangeas, and willows survive transplant fairly easily. Established large shrubs such as Viburnum or Hibiscus syriacus have a harder time. Established conifers often transplant poorly and don&rsquo;t have a particularly high survival rating. Part of the trick is to get an intact root ball of sufficient size for the shrub. Dwarf plants often move easier than their larger counterparts.</p>

                                 <h3>Want your roses to be better than ever? Here are some helpful tips to keep the flowers coming all season.</h3>


								<ul>
								<li>Deadhead your roses. Plants that are allowed to set seeds are less likely to continue blooming, so remove spent flowers. Make cuts just above the first set of five leaves that faces out, away from the center of the plant.</li>
								<li>Prune out branches that grow toward the center of the plant to allow for good air flow.</li>
								<li>Fertilize after the first flush of flowers if finished, and follow the directions on your fertilizer of choice.</li>
								<li>Monitor for diseases. Black spot, rust and powdery mildew proliferate in temperate humid weather, so be on the lookout for these rose nemeses! Pick off leaves at the first sign of infiltration!</li>
								<li>Spray for diseases if needed. Serenade is an OMRI listed fungicide with a bacteria as the active ingredient that is listed for treatment of black spot, powdery mildew and rust. It will not remove what is present, but it can prevent further damage.</li>
								<li>Aphids will arrive soon if they haven’t already. Ladybugs are a great insecticide, as are little birds, and often a strong stream of water is enough to knock aphids to the ground. If you choose to spray, insecticidal soap should be sufficient.</li>
								<li>Mulch the ground under roses. Mulch covers existing spores to prevent them from splashing onto lower leaves, helps to prevent weeds and keeps soil wetter in summer and drier in winter.</li>
								<li>Water roses in the morning, and try to keep leaves dry. Soaker hoses are your allies in the quest to keep roses looking lush.</li>
								</ul>
