	            <h3>Preparing the soil</h3>

<p>Roses grow best in well-drained soil with a pH around 6.5. Creating a rose planting bed, with a large area of amended soil, gives roses a great start. Turn soil over to 12” deep and in as wide an area as possible.</p>
<p>Add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compost or rose planting mix, 1 part compost to 3 parts soil</li>
<li>Lime</li>
<li>Rose fertilizer</li>
</ul>
<p>Blend amendments into the bed evenly.</p>
<p>If creating a bed is not possible, dig a 12” deep x 18” wide hole and mix soil well with the above amendments.</p>

                <h3>Planting a Bare Root Rose</h3>

                <p>Follow soil prep instructions above.</p>

				<p>Space roses 3' apart for average size (3-6' tall) roses; 5' apart for roses that sucker or ramble.</p>

				<p>Dig a hole, 12” x 18”, and make a cone-shape soil mound in the bottom of the hole. If soil is dry, fill the hole with water and allow to drain.</p>

				<p>Add compost (roses love mushroom compost) to the soil that was taken from the hole. The mix should be 1 part compost to 2 parts soil. Add bone meal or an organic rose food to the mix as well. Read the label for amounts. Use the mix to build a mound of soil in the middle of the hole.</p>

				<p>Place the plant above the mound so the bud union (swelling at the base of the stem) is above or at ground level.</p>

				<p>Fill the hole 2/3 full with the compost and soil mix. Lightly tap the soil to remove air pockets. Fill in with remaining soil so that soil level is level around the base of the rose.</p>

				<p>Water thoroughly and slowly.</p>

                                 <h3>Want your roses to be better than ever? Here are some helpful tips to keep the flowers coming all season.</h3>


								<ul>
								<li>Deadhead your roses. Plants that are allowed to set seeds are less likely to continue blooming, so remove spent flowers. Make cuts just above the first set of five leaves that faces out, away from the center of the plant.</li>
								<li>Prune out branches that grow toward the center of the plant to allow for good air flow.</li>
								<li>Fertilize after the first flush of flowers if finished, and follow the directions on your fertilizer of choice.</li>
								<li>Monitor for diseases. Black spot, rust and powdery mildew proliferate in temperate humid weather, so be on the lookout for these rose nemeses! Pick off leaves at the first sign of infiltration!</li>
								<li>Spray for diseases if needed. Serenade is an OMRI listed fungicide with a bacteria as the active ingredient that is listed for treatment of black spot, powdery mildew and rust. It will not remove what is present, but it can prevent further damage.</li>
								<li>Aphids will arrive soon if they haven’t already. Ladybugs are a great insecticide, as are little birds, and often a strong stream of water is enough to knock aphids to the ground. If you choose to spray, insecticidal soap should be sufficient.</li>
								<li>Mulch the ground under roses. Mulch covers existing spores to prevent them from splashing onto lower leaves, helps to prevent weeds and keeps soil wetter in summer and drier in winter.</li>
								<li>Water roses in the morning, and try to keep leaves dry. Soaker hoses are your allies in the quest to keep roses looking lush.</li>
								</ul>

<h3>Rose Care</h3>
<p>You are most of the way to growing successful roses already. At this point, you have selected a site with good sun, allowed for proper air circulation, prepared a bed with well-drained soil, and planted your rose correctly. For continued success, there are a few more things to know.</p>
<p>Watering</p>
<p>Water once a week with soaker hoses for 30-45 minutes during the first spring-summer while plants are getting established. Morning is the best time. After plants are established, water deeply, but infrequently.</p>
<p>Feeding</p>
<p>The happiest roses are fertilized. Apply lime once a year to keep pH higher in acidic soil. In addition, any good rose food used as directed will work. Feed from first growth until September 1.</p>
<p>Please be aware that fertilizers which incorporate systemic insecticides may be a hazard to the health of bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>Pruning</p>
<p>Major rose pruning happens around President’s Day in late February.</p>
<p>For all roses – remove dead branches, 1-3 of the oldest canes on established roses all the way to the ground, branches that grow toward the interior of the plant rather than toward the outside, spindly growth and rose hips.</p>
<p>For climbers – follow the above directions. Tie and train any wayward canes to a support system and do not prune low to the ground.</p>
<p>For shrubby types Hybrid Tea, Floribunda, etc. follow the above directions, then prune remaining branches to 12”.</p>

<p>See our <a href="/roses/rose-pruning">Rose Pruning page</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Moving a Rose Bush</h3>

				 <p>Roses can be moved in autumn without too much trouble. They should be moved later in autumn, the middle to late part of October or the first part of November. More precisely, it is best done once the season has definitely cooled off but before it has rained so much that the soil will be saturated. Before digging up the rose, have the new site prepared. This means get the soil loosened and mixed with compost.</p>

                        <p>It would not hurt to add a bit of bone meal or organic granular transplanting fertilizer, but quick acting fertilizers are not recommended for this. Cut the rose bush back to about 18 inches tall, pruning as you otherwise would in February. Then dig up the plant, keeping as much of an intact root ball as you can manage. Move the plant promptly to the new spot, making sure the soil level as it relates to the bush stays the same; don&rsquo;t bury the stem.</p>

                        <p>Water it in afterwards to settle the soil, and apply a thin layer of mulch; again, don&rsquo;t bury the stem. The plant shouldn&rsquo;t need further care until spring growth starts.</p>

                        <p>Some shrubs handle this sort of treatment better than others. Roses, butterfly bushes, Hydrangeas, and willows survive transplant fairly easily. Established large shrubs such as Viburnum or Hibiscus syriacus have a harder time. Established conifers often transplant poorly and don&rsquo;t have a particularly high survival rating. Part of the trick is to get an intact root ball of sufficient size for the shrub. Dwarf plants often move easier than their larger counterparts.</p>
