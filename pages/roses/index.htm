                <p>We are wild about roses! There’s nothing quite like stuffing one’s nose into a big dewy rose bloom and taking a long sniff! That’s why we always offer a huge selection of traditional favorites and new additions every spring.</p>

                <p>Our bare root roses arrive in February, and our potting crews get right to work planting them in containers. All are sold in pots, rather than bare-root, which protects their roots from breaking and drying out. Rose flowers are hard to resist, so when they bloom, our selection fades. Please call in advance to find current availability.</p>

                <p>You can find our best selection of roses in March and early April when our potting process is complete.</p>

                <p>Our rose buyer carefully selects the best varieties based on color, fragrance, and disease resistance. You'll find all the roses we plan to bring in this spring in our handy Rose Lists.</p>

                      <p>We are really excited to partner with the Portland Rose Festival Foundation to offer the Official Rose of the 2020 Festival: Princess Power!</p>

<p>This Hybrid Tea has well-formed formal double flowers that sit atop long stems perfect for adding to bouquets. Petals appear to be hand-painted pink, with a cream reverse and exude a light fruity scent. Lush foliage is a dark glossy green and disease resistance is good!</p>

<p>Portland Nursery is the exclusive provider of ‘Princess Power’. It will be available at both of our stores beginning in February of 2020.</p>

<p>For every Princess Power rose purchased, Portland Nursery will donate $2.00 to the Portland Rose Festival Foundation.</p>

                             <p>Roses come in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colors, and placing them in classes helps us organize roses that have similar characteristics. The American Rose Society resets classification schemes from time to time, adjusting to new developments in roses.</p>

<p>Learning the lingo will help you when shopping.</p>

<p><strong>Single</strong> – a flower type with few petals, usually 5.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-double</strong> – fewer petals than double, ruffled look with visible yellow centers Double – a flower type with many petals, often set in spirals.</p>
<p><strong>Cupped</strong> – the outer petals form a cup shape, holding other petals tightly.</p>
<p>Bud Union (graft) – a bulbous spot at the base where stems unite with roots. Own-root – roses grown on their own roots rather than grafted (they will not have a bud union).</p>
<p><strong>Hardy</strong> – refers to the minimum temperatures a plant can withstand, not a plant’s vigor.</p>
<p><strong>Disease Resistant*</strong> – these plants have shown resistance to at least one of the many fungal afflictions that affect roses in Portland, and may perform better in our rainy climate than others.</p>
<p><em>*It does not mean “Disease Proof”.</em></p>
