                <p>We are wild about roses! There’s nothing quite like stuffing one’s nose into a big dewy rose bloom and taking a long sniff! That’s why we always offer a huge selection of traditional favorites and new additions every spring.</p>

                <p>Our bare root roses arrive in February, and our potting crews get right to work planting them in containers. All are sold in pots, rather than bare-root, which protects their roots from breaking and drying out. Rose flowers are hard to resist, so when they bloom, our selection fades. Please call in advance to find current availability.</p>

                <p>You can find our best selection of roses in March and early April when our potting process is complete.</p>

                <p>Our rose buyer carefully selects the best varieties based on color, fragrance, and disease resistance. You'll find all the roses we plan to bring in this spring in our handy Rose Lists.</p>

                      <h3>Portland Rose Festival 2021 Collectors Rose</h3>

<p>The Portland Rose Festival Foundation has introduced its 2021 Official Rose, “Burst of Hope,” in partnership with Portland Nursery. Following up on its theme for the new year: 'Hope Reigns,' the Festival is introducing this colorful single stem rose with large pink and yellow striped blooms to add a "Burst of Hope" to every garden.</p>

<p>This unique Grandiflora features a strong fruity and citrus fragrance, with lovely medium-long stems and dark glossy green foliage. This medium-tall, large-flower rose is another of hybridizer Christian Bédard's creations introduced by grower Weeks Roses.</p>

<p>“Burst of Hope” is available exclusively at the Portland Nursery beginning in early February. The cost is $29.99 with $2 of each sale going to the nonprofit, Portland Rose Festival Foundation.</p>

                             <p>Roses come in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colors, and placing them in classes helps us organize roses that have similar characteristics. The American Rose Society resets classification schemes from time to time, adjusting to new developments in roses.</p>

									<p>Learning the lingo will help you when shopping.</p>

									<p><strong>Single</strong> – a flower type with few petals, usually 5.</p>
									<p><strong>Semi-double</strong> – fewer petals than double, ruffled look with visible yellow centers Double – a flower type with many petals, often set in spirals.</p>
									<p><strong>Cupped</strong> – the outer petals form a cup shape, holding other petals tightly.</p>
									<p>Bud Union (graft) – a bulbous spot at the base where stems unite with roots. Own-root – roses grown on their own roots rather than grafted (they will not have a bud union).</p>
									<p><strong>Hardy</strong> – refers to the minimum temperatures a plant can withstand, not a plant’s vigor.</p>
									<p><strong>Disease Resistant*</strong> – these plants have shown resistance to at least one of the many fungal afflictions that affect roses in Portland, and may perform better in our rainy climate than others.</p>
									<p><em>*It does not mean “Disease Proof”.</em></p>
