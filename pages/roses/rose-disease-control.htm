                <h3>Black Spot</h3>

                                        <p>A customer asks:</p>
	                                        <p><em>&ldquo;My roses are starting to develop disease, with black splotching on the leaves. What to do?&rdquo;</em></p>

                        <p>This one is familiar to most experienced rose growers. It is one of several diseases that affect roses, and is usually called black spot (Diplocarpon rosae). As shown above, the leaves develop black blotches and the surrounding tissue turns yellow. The disease can cause significant defoliation and reduces the vigor of the plants, and can eventually kill them.</p>

                        <p>Cultural treatment is your best defense for this. This means picking infected leaves off the plant, removing fallen, infected matter under the plant, providing adequate air circulation and plenty of direct sunlight, and keeping the leaves dry when watering the plant. Overhead sprinklers are a big &lsquo;no-no&rsquo; with roses.</p>

                        <p>Try spreading the frequency of watering out as far as possible between deep soakings. Also, be careful of companion plants requiring more water than roses like. Some roses are more susceptible to disease than others, with wild and shrub roses showing much better resistance than most floral hybrids (hybrid teas, grandifloras, etc.).</p>

                        <p>Fungicidal sprays can also be used to help control the spread of this disease, but <em>do not kill it off entirely</em>. We sell several sprays that can help, including copper soap, flowable sulfur (don&rsquo;t confuse these two with the dormant sprays) and Fung-onil.</p>

	                                <h3>Rust, Powdery Mildew Solutions</h3>
									      <p>Another of those leaf diseases that rose growers are familiar with is popping up its head now. Commonly called rust, there are a number of diseases that all look similar and have similar consequences. Rose rust (Phragmidium sp.) is common and many perennials in the mallow family (especially hollyhock, but also Mallow and <em>Lavatera</em>) get the undersides of the leaves affected by their version of this disease (Puccinia malvacearum).</p>

                        <p>These diseases can cover leaves and drain the plant&rsquo;s energy, and can cause leaf loss when heavily infected. Fungicides such as Immunox and&nbsp; sulfur can lessen the damage, and it is a good cultural practice to remove heavily infested leaves and avoid wetting the leaves.</p>
