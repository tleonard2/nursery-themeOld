<div class="left"><p>At Portland Nursery we are grateful to have been deemed an essential business by the government and for the opportunity to provide jobs to those who need them. With this designation comes great responsibility, and we are taking it very seriously. We have implemented extensive social distancing measures to protect our staff and community, including:</p>
<ul><li>Asking customers to wear any protective gear they may have and to come prepared with a list.</li>
<li>Asking customers not to touch items unless they intend to buy them and to load all purchased items themselves.</li>
<li>Changing layout to maintain a 6’ distance between customers at all times.</li>
<li>Closing our indoor departments and registers to allow for open air shopping only.</li>
<li>Sanitizing carts, pin pads, etc.</li>
<li>Having designated staff to help customers learn our new way of shopping.</li>
<li>Created a socially distanced check out experience, including marked areas for each customer to stand.</li>
<li>A staff comprised only of people here by choice.</li>
<li>Only taking payment by debit or credit card.</li>
<li>Openly reserving the right to refuse service to anyone not following our safety protocols.</li>
<li>Temporarily closing our bathrooms to reduce spread of germs. </li>
<li>Looking out for each other and making sure sick people stay home. We require doctor’s approval to return to work.</li>
<li>Please leave dogs at home and keep your children close.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these changes have taken a toll on the aesthetics of our beautiful nurseries, but we hope you’ll understand why we have taken these measures.
We hope you find solace in your garden.</p></div>
