                        <h3>Terms</h3>

                        <p><strong>Graft</strong> &mdash; spot at the base of the trunk where it joins with roots. Almost all fruit trees are grafted as it is the only way to ensure that varieties are uniform &mdash; that your Honeycrisp apple is indeed Honeycrisp.</p>

                        <p><strong>Root-stock</strong> &mdash; the rooting portion of the fruit tree. Root-stocks decide how quickly and well a tree will set root and the growth-rate and ultimate size of the tree.</p>

                        <p><strong>Scion</strong> &mdash; the upper, fruit-producing portion of the tree.</p>

                        <p>Fruiting Spurs &mdash; branches that are shorter &amp; fatter than others, which produce fruit.</p>

                        <p><strong>Growth Spurs</strong> &mdash; branches that are long and &amp; slender which produce leaves.</p>

                        <h3>Watering</h3>

                        <p><strong>Water</strong> &mdash; Fruit trees need regular water while rooting and becoming established. Use a soaker hose or sprinkler set at a trickle. Leave water on for 45-60 minutes once a week during the first year. Increase frequency when weather is over 85f.</p>

                        <p>Cut watering in half during the second summer. Once established give trees a deep soaking before heat waves, especially if the tree is fruiting, but regular water is no longer needed.</p>

                        <h3>Pruning</h3>

                        <p>Pruning varies by variety of tree. Some general tips:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Winter pruning enhances stem and leaf growth.</li>

                            <li>Summer pruning enhances fruiting.</li>

                            <li>Cut back growing tips, not fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs are short swollen branches &amp; are easily spotted in winter when the tree is dormant.</li>

                          <h3>Fertilizing</h3>

                        <p>Choose a fertilizer that is for fruit and flowers and follow the package directions exactly. We like E.B. Stone&rsquo;s Fruit Berry and Vine Food.</p>

                        <p>Apply lime twice a year to keep pH levels slightly higher than our typical acidic soils.</p>

                        <h3>Pest &amp; Disease Management</h3>

                        <p>This is a large subject. Portland is subject to a plethora of fungal problems due to rain, and pests are likely to be an issue at some point as well.</p>

                        <p>At the very least:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Rake up fallen leaves in autumn</li>

                            <li>Mulch the ground beneath fruit trees to cover fungal spores</li>

                            <li>Apply dormant spray during winter</li>

                            <li>Keep an eye out for unhealthy leaves or fruit</li>
                        </ul>
