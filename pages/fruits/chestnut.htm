	  		<p>Chestnuts are magnificent large trees with beautiful dark green, glossy leaves which become golden in the fall. In early summer they produce yellow catkins. Two trees are recommended for pollination, and different species will cross pollinate. If space is limited you can plant two trees in one hole, resulting in a multi-trunked tree.</p>

<p>Chestnuts can reach up to one hundred feet for European hybrids (‘Colossal’). They require full sun and well drained soil for nut production. Fruit is contained in a spiny and very sharp capsule called a burr. When fruit reaches maturity the burr turns a yellow- brown and can split. Often the burrs will remain on the tree after fruit maturity and will drop to the ground.</p>

<p>Trees should be spaced forty feet apart for long term production, or twenty feet apart is appropriate for about twenty years. Grafted trees will bear in two to three years and seedlings bear in five to seven years.</p>

<h2>Varieties we normally carry:</h2>

<h3>Chinese</h3>
<p>Huge burrs contain 3-7 large, meaty nuts with delicious flavor. Larger than American chestnuts but not as sweet. Self-fertile, but larger yields with a pollinator. Bears in 3- 5 years, ripening in September.</p>

<h3>Colossal</h3>
<p>Hybrid of Japanese, Chinese and European chestnuts. Large to very large, sweet nuts. Good quality fruit on a beautiful, large tree. Can produce up to 400 pounds of fruit annually!! Two trees are required for pollination. May be susceptible to blight.</p>

<h3>Skioka</h3>
<p>A Chinese type growing to 50’ with a spreading habit, Skioka is a heavy producer of large, sweet nuts. A good pollinator, also may be resistant to Chestnut Blight.</p>

				<figure><img class="img-responsive fr-fil fr-dib" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/fruits/pruningfruit350.jpg" alt="pruning fruit"></figure>

				<p>Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
