			<p>Chestnuts are magnificent large trees with beautiful dark green, glossy leaves. In early summer they produce yellow catkins, and in early fall they make delicious nuts.</p>

			<p>The chestnuts we carry are of Asian or European parentage, taking advantage of their resistance to chestnut blight. </p>

			<p>Mature European hybrid chestnuts, like ‘Colossal’, can reach up to one hundred feet tall, while Chinese chestnuts are often closer to 40-60’ tall. They require full sun, well drained soil, and pollen from another chestnut tree for nut production. </p>

				<p>The nut is contained in a spiny and very sharp capsule called a burr; when the nut is ready, the burr will turn yellow-brown and split.</p>

			<p>Trees should be spaced twenty to forty feet apart. If you don’t have room for two majestic nut trees, scout around your neighborhood to see if there might already be a potential mate. Chestnuts are wind-pollinated, so the pollen can travel up to 200 feet. Grafted trees will bear in two to three years, and seedlings bear in five to seven years.</p>
