<p>Well-known in Europe, Sea Berries are highly prized for vitamin rich, orange fruit and graceful ornamental qualities. </p>

<p>Fruit is an excellent source of vitamins C, A & E and makes delicious juice. The flavor is described as extra rich orange juice with added pineapple and passionfruit. </p>

<p>Plants have either male or female flowers, and female plants will produce fruit only when a male plant is present. </p>

<p>Foliage is narrow and frosty blue-green, and branches can be thorny. </p>

<p>Sea Berries adapt to various soil conditions and have no pest or disease problems. </p>

<p>As highly drought tolerant nitrogen fixers they are excellent subjects for use in permaculture and/or organic farming.</p>

<p>Grows to 8-12’ tall – loves full sun – hardy to -40F.</p>
