<p>Hops, <em>Humulus lupulus</em>, are fast-growing, herbaceous perennial vines that can grow from the ground to 25â€™ in the span of one season. </p>

<p>They provide a fast seasonal screen and decorative flowers. </p>

<p>In addition to these qualities, hops flowers are an ingredient in the beer brewing process.</p>

<p>The alpha-acid content provides bitterness to beer, and the natural antibiotics lupulon and humulon keep bacteria from growing during brewing. </p>

<p>Provide strong support and ample space, rich soil & full sun; vines die back to the ground in winter, so plan on annual cleanup. USDA zones 4-8.</p>
