<p>Raspberries are divided into 2 classes by fruit bearing habit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; <strong>June-Bearing</strong>: Bears fruit in early summer on 2 year old canes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; <strong>Everbearing</strong>: Bears fruit on ends of canes late in first season; and laterally on same canes early in second season.</p>

<p><strong>Planting:</strong> Set out plants 1‚Äù deeper than originally grown, spreading the roots 2 1/2 - 3 feet apart. Prune back heavily at planting. Plants will produce 3 - 5 canes the first year. The roots will produce fruit for ten years.</p>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Best in full sun. Well-drained soil is essential. Plants need regular watering: a minimum of one inch of water per week, especially during flowering and fruiting. Feed with balanced fertilizer at blossoming time. Keep the area well weeded.</p>

<p><strong>Staking and Pruning:</strong> Raspberries perform best when trained on supports. String wires at 2 1/2 foot intervals on 2 stout posts spaced 5 feet apart. Tie canes to wire. On June-bearing varieties, prune out entire cane after fruiting. On Everbearing types, prune upper portion of cane after fall fruiting, and then remaining cane after spring crop.</p>
