<p>For the home garden pears are thought to be among the most manageable trees, as well as being prized for their ornamental value. </p>

<p>Pears are also more tolerant of heavy, wet soils than most fruit trees, making them a good choice for western Oregon.</p>

<p>The fruit of European pears is delicious eaten fresh and can be easily dried or canned. The fruit must be picked before ripe and ripened off the tree. In order to tell the right picking time, wait until a full size fruit falls off the tree. </p>

<p>Look for a black ring marking the joint between the stem of the fruit and the spur. If there is a black ring, gently lift and twist the fruit. A mature pear should easily separate from the spur. Another test is the subtle shift in color from green to pale green or golden green (the flesh should still be hard).</p>

 <p>Although the blossoms are attractive to people, they are relatively unattractive to bees. Therefore pears should be planted next to each other, about 15â€™ apart, for better production.</p>

				<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
