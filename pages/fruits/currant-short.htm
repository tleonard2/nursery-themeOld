<p>Currants and gooseberries are a beautiful addition to the landscape with bright spring flowers, colorful berries and lobed foliage. </p>

<p>Currant varieties come in shades of red, black, and white. Red currants are high in pectin, making them ideal for jams and jellies. Black currants have five times the Vitamin C of oranges and make wonderful liqueurs. White currants are typically sweeter and less acidic than red currants and are best eaten fresh.</p>

<p>Gooseberries typically have striped, slightly fuzzy fruit and thorny stems. Both produce small to medium, tart berries great for pies, jams, jellies and preserves. They are high in vitamins
A, B, and C, as well as several minerals.</p>

<p><strong>Pollination:</strong> Most black currants are not self-fertile, so choose at least two different varieties for pollination. All other currants and gooseberries are self-fertile.
However, growing two varieties has been shown to increase production. Jostaberries are self-fertile.</p>

<p><strong>Planting:</strong> Spacing varies with your selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Plant <strong>Black currants</strong> 5-6 feet apart. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Plant <strong>Red & White Currants</strong> 3-5 feet apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Plant <strong>Gooseberries</strong> 2-5 feet apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Plant <strong>Jostaberries</strong> 6-8 feet apart.</p>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong> These berries prefer well-drained soil, kept moist but not soggy. They have shallow roots, so cultivate only near the surface.</p>

<p><strong>Pruning:</strong> The best time to prune is in late winter when the bush is dormant. Generally you do not need to start pruning until the bush is well established, two to three years after planting. Techniques for pruning are specific for different types:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; <strong>Black currants</strong> bear fruit on one year old wood, and spurs arising off two year old wood. Remove 1/4 to 1/3 of all two year wood, as well as older and weak wood. New shoots are pale and tan. Two year wood is gray and older wood is black.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; <strong>Red and white currants</strong> bear fruit on two to three year old wood. Remove branches more than three years old. Then remove all but six of the new shoots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; <strong>Gooseberries</strong> bear fruit on two to four year old wood. They are pruned like red currants, removing wood older than four years (this wood is dark with multiple branching). Thin the new shoots to the strongest six.</p>
