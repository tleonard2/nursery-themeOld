<p>Providing fragrant and beautiful blossoms and juicy fruit with incomparable flavor, peaches and nectarines are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>Though they may seem like different fruit, botanically, nectarines are just peaches without fuzz. The major problem that both have in our climate is a fungal disease called peach leaf curl, which infects the bud scales in wet weather as the buds begin to swell in mid to late winter.</p>

<p>Strategies to outsmart this fungus include planting curl-resistant varieties, dormant spraying your tree with a copper-based fungicide, or choosing one of the (very cute) genetic dwarf trees that can be put in a container and wheeled under cover during the wet season.</p>

<p>These trees fruit on one-year-old wood, so annual pruning helps keep the new wood growing. Taking off up to half of the previous season’s growth will help to keep an open center form and also encourage more and larger fruit.</p>

<p>The peaches and nectarines we carry are self-fertile.</p>

<h3>Nectarines</h3>

<p>Providing beautiful blossoms and fruit with incomparable flavor, nectarines are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>There are genetic dwarf nectarines available, which reach about 5 or 6 feet. Semi-dwarfing rootstocks such as St. Julian A will produce trees which will only reach 12-15’. Genetic dwarf nectarines are natural dwarf hybrids (they have not been engineered). Genetic dwarfs have been bred to produce normal sized fruit on tightly spaced fruit buds, and require fruit thinning.</p>

<p> These trees are perfect for containers. If the tree is kept in a container it can be moved into a covered area which will help reduce infection of peach leaf curl.</p>

<p>The major problem that nectarines have in this climate is peach leaf curl. It is a fungal disease which infects the bud scales in mid to late winter as the buds begin to swell. Although there are varieties of peaches available which are resistant to the disease, we do not carry many disease resistant nectarines. Cleanliness around infected trees, and dormant sprays with copper help prevent infection. </p>

<h3>Peaches</h3>

<p>Peaches and nectarines are almost identical; the major difference is the fuzzy skin of the peach versus the waxy, smooth skin of the nectarine. Providing beautiful blossoms and fruit with incomparable flavor, peaches are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>There are genetic dwarf peaches available which only reach about 5 or 6 feet. Semi- dwarfing rootstocks such as St. Julian A will produce trees which will only reach 12-15’. Genetic dwarf peaches are natural dwarf hybrids (they have been selected not engineered). These selections are then grafted onto a standard rootstock. Genetic dwarfs have been developed to produce normal sized fruit on tightly spaced fruit buds. Therefore they require fruit thinning. These trees require little pruning and are perfect for containers.</p>

<p>The major problem that peaches have in this climate is peach leaf curl, which is a fungal disease which infects the bud scales in mid to late winter as the buds begin to swell. There are varieties of peaches available which are resistant to the disease. Cleanliness around infected trees and dormant sprays with copper help prevent the disease. </p>

	<p>If your tree does get it, feed it with a high nitrogen fertilizer when the first set of leaves drop (a second set of leaves will be produced). Peaches bear fruit on the previous year’s growth, so it is important to get as much growth as possible in the spring.</p>
