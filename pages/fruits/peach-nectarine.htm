<p>Providing fragrant and beautiful blossoms and juicy fruit with incomparable flavor, peaches and nectarines are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>Though they may seem like different fruit, botanically, nectarines are just peaches without fuzz. The major problem that both have in our climate is a fungal disease called peach leaf curl, which infects the bud scales in wet weather as the buds begin to swell in mid to late winter.</p>

<p>Strategies to outsmart this fungus include planting curl-resistant varieties, dormant spraying your tree with a copper-based fungicide, or choosing one of the (very cute) genetic dwarf trees that can be put in a container and wheeled under cover during the wet season.</p>

<p>These trees fruit on one-year-old wood, so annual pruning helps keep the new wood growing. Taking off up to half of the previous seasonâ€™s growth will help to keep an open center form and also encourage more and larger fruit.</p>

<p>The peaches and nectarines we carry are self-fertile.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
