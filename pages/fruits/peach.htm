<p>Peaches and nectarines are almost identical; the major difference is the fuzzy skin of the peach versus the waxy, smooth skin of the nectarine. </p>

<p>Providing beautiful blossoms and fruit with incomparable flavor, peaches are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>There are genetic dwarf peaches available which only reach about 5 or 6 feet. Semi- dwarfing rootstocks such as St. Julian A will produce trees which will only reach 12-15’. Genetic dwarf peaches are natural dwarf hybrids (they have been selected not engineered). These selections are then grafted onto a standard rootstock. Genetic dwarfs have been developed to produce normal sized fruit on tightly spaced fruit buds.</p>

<p>Therefore they require fruit thinning. These trees require little pruning and are perfect for containers.</p>

<p>The major problem that peaches have in this climate is peach leaf curl, which is a fungal disease which infects the bud scales in mid to late winter as the buds begin to swell. There are varieties of peaches available which are resistant to the disease. </p>

<p>Cleanliness around infected trees and dormant sprays with copper help prevent the disease. If your tree does get it, feed it with a high nitrogen fertilizer when the first set of leaves drop (a second set of leaves will be produced). </p>

<p>Peaches bear fruit on the previous year’s growth, so it is important to get as much growth as possible in the spring.</p>
