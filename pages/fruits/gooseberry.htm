<p>Gooseberries are a beautiful addition to the landscape with pretty spring flowers, colorful berries, and handsome fall color. </p>
<p>They typically have striped, slightly fuzzy fruit and thorny stems. Medium-sized, tart berries, in shades of green, yellow, red, or pink are great for pies, cobblers, and tarts. </p>
<p>They are high in vitamins A and C, as well as fiber and several minerals. </p>
<p>Many of the newer varieties have smaller or no thorns, which makes harvesting safer. Gooseberries typically ripen in late June.</p>
