<p>Filberts, aka hazelnuts, are not just an important part of Oregon’s agricultural economy – they’re also the only nut tree that will fit in most urban gardens. Sitting at the border between tree and shrub, they grow to about 12-20 feet tall.</p>

<p>The varieties we carry are cultivars of the European hazel, <em>Corylus avellana</em>, renowned for millennia for its delicious and nutritious nuts. Besides yielding a delightful crop of nuts, they produce a show of highly ornamental catkins (the male flowers) during late winter or very early spring, before the foliage emerges. </p>

<p>Hazels need a compatible partner for cross pollination. Because of genetic and timing factors, planting three varieties is recommended. They should be planted within 15 feet of each other for best results.</p>

<p>The filbert varieties that we carry are immune or resistant to filbert blight.</p>

<p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Hazels form a dense, tall thicket which can make an effective hedge. Prune out some of the older wood each winter to encourage new growth. They can also be trained as tall, multi-stemmed, vase-shaped trees by removing low growing sprouts periodically.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Hazels will begin producing nuts in about 2-3 years. They ripen in fall and are ready for harvesting when the husk can be removed easily. You may either hand pick them or lay a cloth under the tree and tap the limbs to make the nuts drop. Squirrels will be your biggest competitor. Consider netting to preserve some nuts for yourself.</p>
