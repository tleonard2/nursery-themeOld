<p>Prunus is a big genus that includes cherries, plums, peaches and nectarines, apricots, and even non-edible ornamental trees and shrubs. </p>

<p>These species most often reproduce within their own kind, but some species cross more readily than others, and many hybrids have been in cultivation for hundreds of years, like some of our familiar varieties of plums. Hybrids are not GMOs.</p>

<p>Adventurous growers (in the case of the below, the Zaiger family of California) have been working on creating new hybrids that combine familiar characteristics into interesting new taste sensations, so if youâ€™re looking for something a little different, check out these fun trees.</p>
