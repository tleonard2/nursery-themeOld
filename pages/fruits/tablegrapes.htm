<p>Most of these grapes are American varieties which are better suited to our climate. Most are slip skin, with soft flesh and a distinctive, musky flavor and aroma. Some will also make a nice wine. Please see variety descriptions for details.</p>

<p><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant grapes at least 6-8 feet apart with 8-9 feet between rows in well-drained soil. Plant at the same depth as in the pot. Trim vine down to two remaining buds.</p>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Choose a site which is not in a frost pocket, and is parallel to the prevailing winds. Full sun is required to ripen the fruit, so rows are best oriented in a north/south direction. </p>

<p>Grapes are adapted to a wide range of soil types, but do require good drainage. Water newly planted vines regularly (1-2 inches of water per week until mid-summer); mature vines are deeply rooted and require only occasional water. Watering prior to harvest will increase fruit size. </p>

<p>Mulch once a year in spring with aged manure. Too much fertilizer will cause the flower buds to fall off.</p>
