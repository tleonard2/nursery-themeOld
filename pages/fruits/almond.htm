<p>Yes, we can grow almonds with a little protection and good drainage. Almonds are very early bloomers, and therefore should not be planted in frost pockets. </p>

	<p>The nuts require a warm, dry summer to mature. Some varieties require a second variety for cross pollination. They begin to bear in three years. The trees mature at about 15-20’ tall and wide, but can be pruned to 10’.</p>

<p>Good drainage is essential for success. Once the trees are established they are drought tolerant. However, yields are better with regular watering. If annual growth is less than 8” a year, fertilize with a high nitrogen fertilizer in spring. Trees should be pruned to a vase shape. Fruiting spurs remain productive for about five years.</p>

<p>Harvest almonds in fall after hulls have cracked open and partially dried. Shaking the tree will help with harvest. After harvest, remove the hulls and allow the nuts to dry for a few days. Nuts should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
