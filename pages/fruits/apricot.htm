					<p>Apricots can be difficult to grow in the Pacific Northwest, but if successful, the home gardener will enjoy a fruit that is delicious eaten fresh, dried, canned, frozen, and otherwise preserved. </p>
					<p>Apricots tend to bloom during warm periods (above 40ÂºF) in late winter. This means that their blooms may to be damaged by frost. It is a good idea to select later-blooming varieties to avoid this possibility.</p>

					<p>Dormant sprays are a critical tool for growing apricots successfully west of the Cascades. They will provide much needed protection from fungal problems. Copper sprays can be used, but never use sulfur on apricots. Please see the Dormant Spray Schedule handout available at our Information Desk for details.</p>

					<p>Apricots are self-fruitful, and therefore do not require a pollinator. Apricots should be pruned annually, lightly when young and moderately at maturity. The trees have a similar habit to cherries and should be pruned to a modified central leader, and a shape suitable to your garden. The fruits need to be thinned since the trees set unusually heavy crops.</p>

					<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
