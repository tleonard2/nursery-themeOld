					<p>Apricots can be difficult to grow in the Pacific Northwest, but a successful home gardener will enjoy a fruit that is delicious eaten fresh, dried, canned, frozen, and otherwise preserved. </p>

					<p>Apricots tend to bloom during warm periods (above 40ºF) in late winter. This means their flowers may to be damaged by frost, and in a wet spring, pollination can be inhibited. It’s a good idea to select later-blooming varieties to avoid frost damage. If we see heavy rains that decrease insect activity during flowering, consider hand-pollinating by collecting pollen on a paint brush and moving it from flower to flower.</p>

					<p>Dormant sprays are a critical tool for growing apricots successfully west of the Cascades. They will provide much needed protection from fungal problems. Copper sprays can be used, but never use sulfur on apricots.

					<p>Apricots are self-fruitful, and therefore do not require a pollinator. Apricots should be pruned annually, lightly when young and moderately at maturity. The trees have a similar habit to cherries and should be pruned to a modified central leader, and a shape suitable to your garden. The fruits need to be thinned since the trees set unusually heavy crops.</p>
