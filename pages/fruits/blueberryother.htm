<p>Nothing says summer like fresh-picked blueberries. Good news! If you’ve got a sunny spot, there’s a blueberry plant for you. </p>

<p>Most blueberries are high-bush varieties that eventually grow 4’-7’ tall and wide. Some popular varieties include ‘Bluecrop’, ‘Jersey’, and ‘Patriot’. Low-bush and half-high types like ‘Brunswick’ typically grow about a foot tall and spread out several feet. Southern highbush types like ‘Sunshine Blue’ often stay under 4’ tall, and are evergreen. The smaller types grow well in pots. </p>

<p>Blueberries prefer full sun—at least 6-8 hours per day in spring and summer. They do best in well-drained soil amended with compost. They need acidic soil (pH of 4.5 to 5.5). Our native soils are slightly acidic, but fertilizing with an organic acid plant food (such as for azaleas) will help maintain the right pH. For blueberries in pots, use a planting mix formulated for acid-loving plants. </p>

<p>Blueberries need regular watering in the summer, especially as young plants get established. Mulch around the base of the plant with wood chips or compost to help retain moisture.</p>

<p>Most blueberries are self-fertile, but you will get more fruit if you plant at least two different varieties with overlapping bloom dates. Depending on the type, blueberries can produce fruit from early to late summer, so if you choose varieties carefully, you can have fruit all season!</p>

<p>To ensure cross-pollination it is best to plant at least two different blueberry varieties. Different varieties produce fruit at different times throughout the summer. Most gardeners plan for bloom times to overlap, (for pollinating purposes) but not be identical. This allows them to eat fewer blueberries for longer, as opposed to getting an abundance of blueberries all at once.

<p>For more information on selecting blueberries, please see this year's <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/fruits/BlueberryTable.pdf" target="_blank">Blueberry Table</a> of varieties or stop by either location for expert advice. Happy snacking!</p>

<p>Blueberries are not only easy to grow, but decorative as well. The flowers are dainty and bell-shaped with unique pink and blue coloring. In the fall after you’ve enjoyed all those tasty berries, the leaves turn beautiful shades of red, yellow and orange, giving you vibrant fall color. Their stems add color and form to barren winter gardens. Blueberries have much more to offer than tasty berries, making them the perfect plant for year-round interest.</p>
