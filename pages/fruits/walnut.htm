<p>Walnuts are large, stately trees with bold, compound leaves and graceful branching. They provide dappled shade and have deep roots making them a great shade tree for lawn areas. There are two main types of walnuts: English (aka Persian) and black walnuts.</p>

<p>English walnuts (<em>Juglans regia</em>) grow to 50-60 feet tall and 50-70 feet wide at maturity. They begin bearing in five to eight years or two to three years if grafted. The nuts fall free of their husks when mature. English walnuts grow best in Zones 6-9.</p>

<p>Black walnuts (<em>Juglans nigra</em>) are fast growing trees reaching 40-70 feet tall and 50-60 feet wide. They can take a bit longer than English walnuts to produce and are sealed in a tough husk that has to be removed for harvesting. Not only do black walnuts yield a high protein nut, but they also produce a beautiful timber. </p>

<p>Black walnuts are native to the river banks of the Midwest, and they do quite well in swampy soils. They do posses a property known as allelopathy which prevents many plants from growing under the trees because of chemicals released by them. For this reason black walnut leaves are not good for the compost pile. Black walnuts grow best in Zones 4-8.</p>

<p><strong>Care:</strong> Both types of walnuts thrive in full sun and deep, well drained soil. They should be given a minimum of 30x30 feet and at least 20 feet from a building to protect the foundation. A fertilizing mulch, such as planting compost, should be applied in spring. Walnuts require adequate water during the growing season.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> English walnuts drop mature nuts after they split out of their husk. Black walnuts drop enclosed in the husk. This husk is dark and stains quickly so wear gloves when harvesting. Place the Black walnuts on your driveway and drive over them, hit them with a hammer or stomp on them to get the husks loose. Wash the nuts and let them dry for a couple of weeks. After harvesting, both types of walnuts may be stored in a cool, dry place for several months or longer in the freezer.</p>

				<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
