<p>Walnuts are large, stately trees with bold, compound leaves and graceful branching. They provide dappled shade and have deep roots making them a great shade tree for lawn areas. There are two main types of walnuts: English (aka Persian) and black walnuts.</p>

<p>English walnuts (<em>Juglans regia</em>) grow to 50-60 feet tall and 50-70 feet wide at maturity. They begin bearing in five to eight years or two to three years if grafted. The nuts fall free of their husks when mature. English walnuts grow best in Zones 6-9.</p>

<p>Black walnuts (<em>Juglans nigra</em>) native to the river banks of the Midwest, are grown for their flavorful nuts and beautiful timber. They possess a property known as allelopathy which prevents many plants from growing under them; this combined with their size makes them hard to accommodate in urban gardens. We do not carry black walnuts.</p>

<p><strong>Care:</strong> Walnuts thrive in full sun and deep, well-drained soil. They should be given a minimum of 30x30 feet and at least 20 feet from a building. Mulch applied in spring will help retain water and reduce competition. Walnuts require adequate water during the growing season. English walnuts are mostly self-fertile, but will produce more heavily with a second variety nearby.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> English walnuts drop mature nuts after they split out of their husk. After harvesting, walnuts in their shells may be stored in a cool, dry place for several months or longer in the freezer.</p>
