<p>Elderberries are extremely hardy, handsome, and easy to grow. </p>

<p>Well suited to many garden styles, they grow best in moist, fertile, well drained soil with at least half a day of direct sun. </p>

<p>The fruit is rich in phosphorous, potassium, and vitamin C, lending a complex flavor to pies, preserves, cordials, and wine. </p>

<p>Highly attractive to bees, butterflies, and birds as an important food, shelter, and nectar source. As the plants flower in June they are seldom damaged by late frosts. Zones 4-9.</p>
