<p>Also known as hazelnuts, these trees produce small, plump nuts with a delicious flavor. </p>

	<p>The varieties we carry are cultivars of the European hazel, <em>Corylus avellana</em> and are a popular orchard crop in the Northwest. Besides yielding a delightful crop of nuts, they produce a show of highly ornamental catkins during late winter or very early spring, before the foliage emerges.</p>

<p><strong>Site:</strong> All do best in light, loamy soil that is well drained. Full sun or some afternoon shade is best. Most hazels need a compatible partner for cross pollination. They should be planted within 15 feet of each other for best results.</p>

<p><strong>Pruning Hazels:</strong> Hazels form a dense, tall thicket which can make an effective hedge. Prune out some of the older wood each winter to encourage new growth. They can also be trained as tall, multi-stemmed, vase-shaped trees by removing the root sprouts periodically.</p>

<p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Hazels will begin producing nuts in about 2-3 years. They ripen in fall and are ready for harvesting when the husk can be removed easily. You may either hand pick them or lay a cloth under the tree and tap the limbs to make the nuts drop. Nets may be used to keep the squirrels away.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
