			<p>Yes, figs can grow in the Portland area! Given a warm, sunny location, you can enjoy the voluptuous pleasures of this storied exotic.</p>

			<p>Green, mahogany, to nearly black colored fruit with juicy red or amber flesh ripens during hot summer months. Ripe fruit will be soft to the touch and dangle loosely on the stem. Many of our varieties produce a second crop of fruit in September, and all of the varieties we carry are self-fertile.</p>

			<p>Fig trees are pest-free, adaptable to many climate and soil conditions, and drought tolerant once established. They can be pruned as a lower-growing shrub, espaliered onto a fence or hot wall, or allowed to sprawl. Theyâ€™re very tolerant of different pruning styles; fruiting on the growth from one-year-old wood means that regular pruning can help encourage more production.</p>

			<p>The varieties we carry are winter hardy here and have mature sizes ranging from 5 to 25 feet tall. </p>
