<p> Mulberries come in shades from white through pink, red, and almost black.</p>

<p>This diversity emerges from three main species and hybrids, among them: <em>Morus alba</em>, which is native to Asia; <em>Morus rubra</em>, native to eastern North America; and <em>Morus nigra</em>, which features in classic Persian, Turkish, and Greek cuisines.</p>

<p>Eat them fresh, dried, juiced, or in baked goods. All varieties are self- fertile and have few pests or disease problems.</p>

<p>These vigorous growers should be trained to a strong scaffold in their youth, with minimal ongoing pruning needed, except to keep the fruit within reach. Prune in spring, before the buds open, and avoid removing large branches. Birds and children love mulberries - consider netting the ones youâ€™ll eat and sharing the rest!</p>
