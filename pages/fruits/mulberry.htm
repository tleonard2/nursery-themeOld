<p>Native to western Asia, the black mulberry has been in cultivation in Europe since pre-Roman times. </p>

<p>Trees are self-fertile with large and juicy fruit. Flavor has a refreshing tart/sweet balance reminiscent of grapefruit. Fruit ripens in late summer and is great eaten fresh, dried, in baking, or for winemaking.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
