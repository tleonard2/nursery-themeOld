		<p>Cherries come in a variety of colors, textures and flavors. Sweet cherries are those found in stores for fresh eating.</p>

		<p>Some commonly seen varieties are ‘Bing’, a nice tasty red, or ‘Rainier’, a sweeter yellow cherry considered by many to be exotic. ‘Royal Ann’ is a yellow variety often dolled up to make maraschino cherries. In grocery stores you’ll find tart or sour cherries in the canned food aisle, ready to be made into pies.</p>

		<h3>Pollination</h3>

		 Cherry pollination is somewhat complex. Some varieties are self-fertile, so they can be planted alone and still bear fruit. They will bear larger crops if a cherry of a different type is planted nearby. Some varieties must be pollinated, so 2 trees must be planted, and many varieties are picky about which trees will work for pollination. See our Pollination list in our <a target="_blank" href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/fruits/CherryPollination-Rootstocks.pdf">Pollination and Rootstock charts</a>.

		<h3>Culture</h3>

		<p>Improved soil drainage and ample air circulation are the keys to success with cherries. Mix compost into the soil before planting to ensure an active, well-established root system, and place the tree in a location with plenty of space. Cherries are sensitive to drought, so regular, deep watering in summer is essential. We recommend an hour of slow watering once a week during dry periods. Cherries are susceptible to a variety of diseases and pests. Please ask for a handout at our Information Desk for spray guidelines to help you prevent possible problems.</p>
