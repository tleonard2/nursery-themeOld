		<p>Cherries come in a variety of colors, textures and flavors. Sweet cherries are those found in stores for fresh eating.</p>

		<p>Some commonly seen varieties are ‘Bing’, a nice tasty red, or ‘Rainier’, a sweeter yellow cherry considered by many to be exotic. ‘Royal Ann’ is a yellow variety often dolled up to make maraschino cherries. In grocery stores you’ll find tart or sour cherries in the canned food aisle, ready to be made into pies.</p>

			<h3>Culture</h3>

		<p>Improved soil drainage and ample air circulation are the keys to success with cherries. Mix compost into the soil before planting to ensure an active, well-established root system, and place the tree in a location with plenty of space. Cherries are sensitive to drought, so regular, deep watering in summer is essential. We recommend an hour of slow watering once a week during dry periods. Cherries are susceptible to a variety of diseases and pests. Please ask for a handout at our Information Desk for spray guidelines to help you prevent possible problems.</p>

				<h3>Rootstocks</h3>

				<p>Cherry trees are grafted to roots called ‘rootstocks’ that determine the eventual height and anchoring capabilities of the tree. Rootstocks reduce the size of the tree by a percentage of the standard size. For cherries a standard tree matures at 25’. For example, a cherry grafted to GISELA rootstock will produce a tree about 40% of the size of a standard, so the tree will be dwarf and mature at 8-12’.</p>

				<ul>
				<li><strong>Mazzard:</strong> Standard: 30-40'. Very well anchored, good in heavy soils.</li>

				<li><strong>Mahaleb:</strong> Standard: 24-35'. Better in light soils, drought tolerant.</li>

				<li><strong>Myro:</strong> Semi-dwarf: 22-26'. Bears larger crops earlier in life with disease resistance and good anchoring.</li>

				<li><strong>Gisela:</strong> Dwarf: 12-15'. Productive tree with large fruit at a young age.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Pollination</h3>

				<p>Sweet Cherries requiring pollinators:</p>

				<ul>
				<li><strong>Evans</strong> pollinate with Black Tartarian, Royal Ann or Van.</li>
				<li><strong>Bing</strong> pollinate with Black Tartarian, Carmine Jewel, Early Burlat, Rainier, Sam, Stella or Van.</li>
				<li><strong>Ranier</strong> pollinate with Bing, Black Tartarian, Carmine Jewel, Lambert, Sam, Stella, or Van.</li>
				<li><strong>Royal Ann</strong> pollinate with Black Tartarian, Early Burlat, Sam or Van.</li>
				<li><strong>Sam</strong> pollinate with Bing, Carmine Jewel, Royal Ann, Stella, or Van.</li>
				<li><strong>Van</strong> pollinate with Bing, Carmine Jewel, Early Burlat, Lambert, Rainier, Royal Ann, or Sam.</li>
				</ul>

	<p>Sweet Cherries that are self-fertile (don't require pollinator):</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Bada Bing</li>
					<li>Glacier</li>
					<li>Lapin</li>
					<li>Stella</li>
					<li>Sweetheart</li>
					<li>Vandalay</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Pie cherries are self-fertile but usually will not pollinate sweet cherries.</p>

				<figure><img class="img-responsive fr-fil fr-dib" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/fruits/pruningfruit350.jpg" alt="pruning fruit"></figure>

				<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
