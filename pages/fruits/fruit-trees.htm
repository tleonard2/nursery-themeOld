			<p>Do you want to grow your own fruits or nuts? </p>

				<p>Portland’s mild climate allows for many kinds of fruit and nut trees to be grown. Apples, Figs, Plums and Hazelnuts are just a few of the trees Portland Nursery offers every spring.</p>

			<p>Our selection of fruit trees changes every year, so we post lists annually to help with planning. The list is based on orders that are confirmed by our growers, so they reflect our best estimate of what to expect. However, we don't always receive what is confirmed - there are often changes in root stocks and crop failures can occur. Only after orders arrive are we certain of our stock.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>We plant all of our fruit trees in pots, and do not offer bare-root fruit trees.</p>

			<p>Fruit trees, berries and small fruits begin to arrive in January, and trickle in weekly through winter. Call to check if the varieties you have selected are available before making a special trip.</p>

				<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. </p>

					<p>Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>

			<p>Some fruit trees are self-fertile. This means that they require only one tree to be planted in order to bear fruit. Many fruit trees are not self-fertile and should be planted with a compatible partner to ensure pollination and fruit. Compatible partners are a different variety of the same type of fruit.</p>

<p>Most fruit trees are grafted to roots (root stocks) that change the mature size. Apples, for instance are available on miniature, dwarf, semi – dwarf and standard root stocks that result in trees anywhere from 6’ tall to 35’ tall. Size is also influenced by the vigor of specific varieties.</p>

				<p>Make sure when your are purchasing fruit trees to choose sizes that fit the available space.</p>

<p>The majority of banana plants are tropical and are not hardy to our climate, meaning that they cannot survive our winters outside. That being said, most bananas make fine houseplants and can be grown year-round in a pot, brought in before the threat of frost. Often times they look nice even in the middle of winter, if given reasonably good care. All red-leaved bananas, which can be stunning, fall into this category.</p>

<p>There are two types of bananas that are hardy and can survive our winters. The <em>Musa basjoo</em>, or Japanese hardy banana, is the more common of the two. Additionally, we have  <em>Musella lasiocarpa</em>, the Chinese Flowering Banana, which grows and impressive yellow bloom once reaching about five feet tall. It is a relative of Musa (fruiting banana).</p>

				<p>Many fruit trees are prone to fungal problems in our wet climate. To protect against diseases there are a few simple guidelines to follow.</p>

					<p><strong>Clean up</strong> – rake up leaves in autumn and don’t leave fallen fruit on the ground to rot.</p>
					<p><strong>Spray</strong> with dormant spray at least once a year. Copper sprays are commonly used by organic gardeners.</p>
					<p><strong>Insects</strong> can also be problematic. Organic solutions are specific to the type of fruit and the insects in question.</p>

				<p><strong>And if that’s not enough…</strong> Timing harvests, keeping the birds off and pruning are additional things to learn about when growing fruit trees. Fortunately Portland Nursery offers Fruit Tree Classes every spring.</p>

							<p><em>“My plum seems to be diseased; it has curly, blighted-looking new leaves. What is going on?”</em></p>

                            <p>Plum trees, both fruiting and flowering types, are sometimes susceptible to several leaf-affecting diseases, including the disease known as plum pockets (Taphrina communis), which is similar in appearance to peach-leaf curl (Taphrina deformans).</p>
                            <p>It causes distorted new growth (which is quite unsightly) and ugly, bloated fruit, and drains the energy of the plant. In agriculture, this is usually not a serious issue, but as an ornamental your plum can suffer greatly. Once the symptoms show, control is difficult, even with fungicides.</p>

                            <p>Dormant spraying during the fall and winter (before any spring growth) with copper-based fungicides can improve the plant for the following growing season. Also, clean up under the plant in the fall and winter, and avoid excessive wetting of leaves or too much shade.</p>

                            <p><em>"My plums and blueberries sprouted out, but then the new growth and blossoms died off, and some of the branches are dying back. What is going on?"</em></p>

<p>In early spring, you may see signs of blossom blight which are often some species of fungi called Monilinia. It causes withered new shoots and some twig or branch loss on blueberries as well as cherries, plums, and other Prunus species. The disease usually happens to plants that are already under stress.</p>
<p>Blossom blight occurs when the air-borne fungus is present, the temperatures are moderate, and the leaves/blossoms are moist. Basically I just described Portland in spring.</p>
<p>It can be deterred by pruning out effected branches or fruit in summer, using only moderate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer, and cleaning up thoroughly after autumn leaf fall. There are fungicides that are available to help control the problem if sprayed during and just after blossom.</p>
