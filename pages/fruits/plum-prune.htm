<p>Plums grow in a rainbow of jewel colors, having been grown and hybridized by orchardists for millennia from a variety of parent species.</p>
<p>We carry two main groups of plums: Japanese and European. </p>

<p>Japanese varieties are usually earlier blooming, fleshier, softer and juicier. With the exception of Santa Rosa, Japanese varieties require a pollinizer.</p>

<p>The European plums tend to be later blooming, later ripening and usually self-fruitful. For the most part they are sweeter than Japanese plums. Some European varieties contain more natural sugar, making for better drying; these are called “prunes” or “prune plums.”</p>

<p>Plums, like cherries and other stone fruits, should be pruned in dry weather – summer, in our climate – to avoid bacterial and fungal infection. An open center form allows maximum air flow, sun exposure, and easiest access for harvest.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
