<p>Plums grow in a rainbow of jewel colors, having been grown and hybridized by orchardists for millennia from a variety of parent species.</p>

<p>We carry two main groups of plums: Japanese and European. </p>

<p>Japanese varieties are usually earlier blooming, fleshier, softer and juicier. Most Japanese varieties require a pollinizer.</p>

<p>The European plums tend to be later blooming, later ripening and usually self-fruitful (but bear more with a pollinizer). For the most part they are sweeter than Japanese plums. Some European varieties contain more natural sugar, making for better drying; these are called “prunes” or “prune plums.”</p>

<p>Plums, like cherries and other stone fruits, should be pruned in dry weather – summer, in our climate – to avoid bacterial and fungal infection. An open center form allows maximum air flow, sun exposure, and easiest access for harvest.</p>
