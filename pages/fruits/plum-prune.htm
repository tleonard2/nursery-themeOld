<p>There are two main families: Japanese and European. Japanese varieties, with the exception of Santa Rosa require a pollinator. </p>

<p>Japanese varieties are usually earlier blooming, fleshier, softer and juicier.</p>

<p>The European plums are usually hardier, later blooming, later ripening and usually self-fruitful. For the most part they are sweeter than Japanese plums.</p>

<p>Prunes are actually types of European varieties which contain more natural sugar, making for better drying.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tree Pruning:</strong> Most fruit trees require regular pruning to establish good structure and enhance fruit quality. A well-pruned tree allows air and light penetration, which help with disease prevention and fruit ripening. Different types of fruit trees require specific pruning practices due to their growth and fruit bearing habits. Please refer to the table in our handout for specifics.</p>
