<p>Asian pears are a beautiful addition to the home garden. The trees have showy flowers, large, attractive leaves, beautiful bark, and nice fall color. Each variety has a different mixture of subtle flavors and is a refreshing treat for the palate.</p>

<p>Asian pears should be ripened on the tree and harvest time varies by variety. When the estimated ripeness date is near, pick a pear and taste it! If itâ€™s crisp, sweet and juicy, harvest time has arrived. Asian Pears retain their crispness long after harvest when properly stored and can be easily canned.</p>

<p>Although the rootstocks used for Asian pears are the same as those used for European pears, Asian pears are smaller growing trees.</p>

<p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Asian Pears are best pruned using the central leader method but an open center pruning form can be employed. Fruiting spurs (blooming wood) forms on 2-6 year old branches.</p>
