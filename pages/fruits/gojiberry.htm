<p>Native to China, the Goji Berry (also commonly called Wolf Berry) is a handsome, fine-textured shrub with light purple, bell-shaped flowers from late spring into summer. </p>

<p>Berries ripen continually from mid-summer into late fall. Delicious eaten fresh, dried, or used in cooking and baking. </p>

<p>The fruit is pleasantly sweet and rich in flavor, and is among the highest in anti-oxidants, essential amino acids, fiber, and many vitamins and minerals. An all-around super-food!</p>

<p>Berries grow on new growth on this vigorous plant, so plan on pruning each winter. Pruning back the tips of long branches will encourage side branching and result in a denser plant and increased fruit production.</p>
