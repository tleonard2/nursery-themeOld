<p>Providing beautiful blossoms and fruit with incomparable flavor, nectarines are worth the maintenance it takes to grow them in our climate.</p>

<p>There are genetic dwarf nectarines available, which reach about 5 or 6 feet. Semi-dwarfing rootstocks such as St. Julian A will produce trees which will only reach 12-15â€™. Genetic dwarf nectarines are natural dwarf hybrids (they have not been engineered). Genetic dwarfs have been bred to produce normal sized fruit on tightly spaced fruit buds, and require fruit thinning.</p>

<p> These trees are perfect for containers. If the tree is kept in a container it can be moved into a covered area which will help reduce infection of peach leaf curl.</p>

<p>The major problem that nectarines have in this climate is peach leaf curl. It is a fungal disease which infects the bud scales in mid to late winter as the buds begin to swell. Although there are varieties of peaches available which are resistant to the disease, we do not carry many disease resistant nectarines. Cleanliness around infected trees, and dormant sprays with copper help prevent infection. </p>
