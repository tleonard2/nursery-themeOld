                        <h2>Starting Sunflowers</h2>

                        <p>Did you know sunflowers exhibit a characteristic called heliotropism? This means the flowers will move to face the sun through the course of a day. There are a few perennial types: <strong><em>Helianthus angustifolius</em> &lsquo;Gold Lace&rsquo;, <em>Helianthus</em> &lsquo;Flore Pleno&rsquo; and <em>Helianthus</em> &lsquo;Lemon Queen&rsquo;.</strong> These varieties come back every year reaching lofty heights of 6-7&rsquo; tall with masses of 2-4&rdquo; yellow flowers.</p>

                        <p>As the name might imply, sunflowers require full sun (at least 8 hours), fertile soil and deep infrequent water to thrive. If you allow your sunflowers to drop seeds where they grew, you are likely to get volunteers the following season!</p>

                        <p><strong>Starting from seed:</strong> You can get a jump start on your sunflowers by starting them indoors, in 4&rdquo; pots, under lights 2-3 weeks before planting outdoors (generally early April). Seeds can be directly planted mid to late April through May. Birds, cutworms or slugs may eat new seedlings so take precautions to protect them, or plant some extra seed. Thin seedlings 4-24&rdquo; apart depending on the eventual size of the variety. If continuous bouquet harvest is your goal, we recommend planting seeds every 10-14 days, or selecting varieties with different maturity dates.</p>

                        <p><strong>Starting with plants:</strong> We have a large selection of sunflower starts beginning in early May. Below are some highlights. Please call for current availability.</p>
