                <p>Plant research and production began when Butterfly Bush (<em>Buddleia davidii</em>) was taken off of the market in 2008.</p>

                <p>The mission was to find Buddleia that are seedless, since the Butterfly Bush that we had all fallen in love with reproduces at an incredible rate & bullies its way into waterways, street-sides & pastures.</p>

                <p>Several varieties of Seedless Butterfly Bush are the result of this research, with each year bringing more great selections. The Oregon Department of Agriculture has approved all available varieties, with one caveat: <em><strong>We can't call it Butterfly Bush any more. In their view, Butterfly Bush is synonymous with the seedy type (B. davidii).</strong></em> So when you're shopping for the new seedless forms, look for plants with the common names Summer Lilac, Nectar Bush or Seedless Butterfly Bush.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODA/programs/NurseryChristmasTree/Pages/ButterflyBush.aspx" target="_blank">Read more about the review process and ODA rules here.</a></p>

                <p>Why did we fall in love with Butterfly Bush in the first place? That's easy. Summer flowers that smell delicious and feed butterflies and hummingbirds, frosty blue-green leaves, drought tolerance and fast growth.</p>

                <p>The new seedless <em>Buddleia</em> don't have as broad a range of colors as before (no dark purple yet) but the range of mature sizes is broader (2' to 15') and so as long as you have a good splash of afternoon sunshine, there is a <em>Buddleia</em> that will fit your yard.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Buddleia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Scrophulariaceae, Buddlejaceae, Loganiaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Buddleia or Buddleja (bud-LEE-uh) – named for the Reverend Adam Buddle, an amateur botanist from England.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Seedless Butterfly Bush, Nectar Bush, Summer Lilac (formerly known as Butterfly Bush).</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to East Asia and South America.</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> About 100 species of shrubs and small trees, deciduous or evergreen (deciduous in Oregon), square stems & mostly opposite leaves. Summer flowers in clusters are white, apricot, orange, pink, red, lavender or purple. Butterflies and Hummingbirds feed on nectar from Buddleia flowers.</p>

                        <p>The species <em>Buddleia davidii</em> produces copious seeds that sprout easily and are invasive. A single flower cluster of <em>Buddleia davidii</em> 'Potter's Purple' can make up to 40,000 seeds! Seeds can be carried long distances and proliferate in open areas like roadways, waterways and pastures.</p>

                        <p><em>Buddleia davidii</em> is considered a noxious weed in Oregon and is illegal to sell in the state, but so far is legal to have in your yard. Still, it's a good idea to support our waterways and replace the seedy Butterfly Bush with seedless types.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ODA/programs/NurseryChristmasTree/Pages/ButterflyBush.aspx" target="_blank">Read more about Oregon's rules surrounding Buddleia here.</a></p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> varies</p>

                        <p>Low – 2-3' x 2-3'</p>

                        <p>Medium – 4-5' x 4-5'</p>

                        <p>Large – 6-10' x 6-10'</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Buddleia</em> grows best in full sun with well-drained soil. Once it's rooted into an area, <em>Buddleia</em> needs little summer water, but it does appreciate deep watering during extreme heat. Remove spent flowers to encourage budding. Some varieties bloom on old wood, so must be pruned after bloom. Taller varieties grow fast and are a bit brittle and rangy, so pruning is often a necessity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> There are a few problems. First, while we are super happy to have so many options in new seedless <em>Buddleia</em> colors, we have not yet seen a dark purple variety. Those of us who loved 'Black Knight' need a good seedless dark purple please! STAT!</p>

                        <p>Diseases are few. Overwatering can cause root-rot, so once plants are established, limit summer water.</p>

                        <p>Butterfly caterpillars may feed on leaves, so when holes appear in leaves, view it as a happy thing. It's important NOT to spray butterfly host plants with insecticides.</p>

                        <p><em>Buddleias</em> that grow fast can be gangly and brittle, so keep that in mind when planning your garden. The pay-off of more butterflies and hummingbirds flitting about is probably worth it, but try a low-growing variety if you find junior high gawkiness too much to take.</p>
