                <p>Camellias are one of the most-loved garden shrubs in Portland. They are festooned with flowers for months and if planned correctly, one could have Camellias blooming in one's garden for six months of the year!</p>

                <p>In summer, when finished with the work of blooming, their evergreen leaves and strong stature make a great screen or hedge. Year-round, Camellias are good habitat plants for wildlife as well. Hummingbirds feed on winter flowers and thick foliage provides cover for critters.</p>

                <p>The Camellias that are most commonly found in nurseries can be divided into three groups: Winter-blooming - <em>Camellia sasanqua,</em> spring-blooming - <em>Camellia japonica</em> and <em>Camellias</em> for tea - <em>Camellia sinensis.</em></p>

                <h3>We carry around fifty varieties of <em>Camellia</em> but these are some Portland Nursery favorites:</h3>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Theaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Camellia</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Camellia</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Japan & China</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Camellias have been in cultivation for eons and there are hundreds if not thousands of varieties.</p>

                        <p><strong>Winter Camellias - <em>Camellia sasanqua</em></strong></p>

                        <p>Winter Camellias bloom in Portland from late October into February. Flowers are sweetly scented, smaller than Japanese Camellias and hold up to winter rain better than Japanese Camellias. Flower forms are single, semi-double or anemone. Colors range from white to red and every version of pink in between. Leaves are dark matte green and evergreen. Many C. sasanquas have an upright open structure and some grow in a lower fountain shape.</p>

                        <p><strong>Spring Camellias - <em>Camellia</em> <em>japonica</em><br></strong></p>

                        <p>Spring Camellias can begin to bloom as early as December depending on weather, but high season is March and April. Flowers are medium to large and are typically unscented. Colors range from white to pink to red, and even come in pale yellow! Flowers tend to get heavy in spring rains and are considered messy by some when they drop on the ground. Evergreen leaves are big and glossy, and a indeed mature C. japonica casts dense shade.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tea Camellias - <em>Camellia sinensis</em></strong></p>

                        <p>You can grow tea in Portland! Leaves from Tea Camellia are what is used to make green and black teas. Flowers are usually white or occasionally pale pink and bloom in October-November. Papery leaves are medium green.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Camellias thrive in acidic soil, which is typical on the west side of the Cascades. Morning sun or dappled shade is ideal for Camellias. It allows for the plant to receive enough sun to produce flowers and protects leaves from being burned by hot afternoon sun. Use fertilizer specified for Camellias, Azaleas or Rhododendrons, as they are all acid-loving plants that can become chlorotic (turn yellow & look sick) without proper nutrients.</p>

                        <p><strong>Diseases:</strong> Camellias are prone to a number of pests and diseases, but in Portland, sucking insects like scale and mealy bug can become problematic, and are often followed by sooty mildew, a black dusty-looking substance which can only be present when sucking insects are also around. A broad range of treatment options is available.</p>
