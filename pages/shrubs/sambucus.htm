                <p>Is <em>Sambucus</em> edible? Yes and no. Elderberry fruit is edible so long as the berries are cooked first, and indeed Elderberry jam, syrup and wine are all delicious reasons to grow <em>Sambucus</em>.</p>

                <p>Elderberry leaves can be green, purple or variegated which adds to their interest, and <em>Sambucus</em> are really easy to care for too, so long as they're given enough room - they do get really big in Portland!</p>

                <p>All parts of the plant except the berries are toxic to humans though, so leaves, woody stems and roots are off limits! Berries that are eaten raw can cause upset stomach and nausea so be sure to prepare them properly.</p>

                <h2><em><em>Sambucus</em> canadensis</em>: American Elder or Elderberry</h2>

                <p>The American Elderberry drips with black berries in summer. Berries are commonly used to make wine, liqueurs &amp; pies. Two different varieties must be planted to provide pollination for fruit production. Portland Nursery carries 'Nova' &amp; 'York'. Leaves are medium green, flowers are creamy white.</p>

                <p>Grows 5-12' tall &amp; wider. Can be pruned &amp; kept on the smaller side. Prune in March.</p>

                <p>Hardy Z2 &ndash; some selections hardy to Z4.</p>

                <h2><em>Sambucus nigra</em>: European or Common Elderberry</h2>

                <p>This species offers a really wide range of leaf colors &amp; makes a great addition to the garden. The purple and green leaf forms are fast-growing and form a pretty fountain shape. They're self-sufficient and easy to grow with few problems. Variegated (2-toned leaf) forms are a bit slower-growing with a bushier shape. They can burning in hot afternoon sun so the ideal site for variegated <em>Sambucus</em> is partly shaded.</p>

                <h2><em>Sambucus</em> nigra 'Black Lace'</h2>

                <p>'Black Lace' is easily our most popular elderberry, and with good reason. It's strappy dark purple leaves really add drama, and they resemble the leaves of Japanese lace-leaf maples. Big clusters of pink flowers stand out against the dark leaves and are followed by black fruit. The most common concern is that 'Black Lace' does a little too well, and gets too big. Literature says they grow to 8-12 feet, but we've seen them at more like 20 feet! Which really is more like a small tree. So give it plenty of room and everyone involved will be happy.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Sambucus</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Caprifoliaceae &ndash; Honeysuckle Family</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sambucus (sam-BOO-cus)</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Elderberry</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to the Americas, Europe, Asia, E &amp; NW Africa, E Australia &amp; Tasmania. Two species are native to Oregon.</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> About 25 species of shrubs, small trees &amp; perennial herbs. Flowers are small &amp; white or pink, held in flat or round clusters. Bloom is in mid-late spring. Black, red or white fruit follows. Leaves are deciduous, compound &amp; opposite &ndash; they have a feathery look &amp; come in many colors; green, white &amp; green, gold &amp; green, gold, purple. Stems are thick, solid &amp; covered in dots (lenticels).</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> In the Pacific Northwest, plants grow fast, mature around 8-12' tall &amp; wider. Plants as large as 20' are common in their native habitats.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun to part shade &ndash; full sun for best fruit production. Moist soil, drought tolerant once established &ndash; still appreciate a nice deep drink in August.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> We haven't observed pests or diseases on ours. Plants can grow larger than anticipated &amp; are difficult to remove, so plan ahead &amp; allow appropriate space.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>We are lucky to have two species of northwest native Elderberry: <strong><em>Sambucus caerulea &amp; Sambucus racemosa</em></strong>. To read more about these species see our feature on the <a href="/natives/sambucus.shtml">Native Sambucus.</a></p>
