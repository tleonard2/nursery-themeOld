                <p>Portlanders have a love-hate relationship with <em>Hebes</em>. We are lured in by flashy evergreen leaves and pretty summer flowers, we think they're wonderful when our winters are mild - then we get the occasional cold snap and (some of them) die. We're sad and angry and we vow never to plant another Hebe...then we fall in love again.</p>

                <p>The thing is that some <em>Hebes</em> are perfectly hardy in Portland. The key is to know which ones are reliable and which ones are not, so if you choose to take a chance on a more tender Hebe, you do it with open eyes, knowing it may end in tears, but ready to enjoy the time you have together.</p>

                <p>Generally speaking, the smaller the leaf, the hardier the Hebe; the more impressive the flowers, the more tender. These are not a hard and fast rules, so always read labels.</p>

                <h2>Hardy <em>Hebes</em></h2>

                <p>We consider <em>Hebes</em> that are hardy in USDA Zone 7 to be reliably hardy in Portland. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

                <h2>Tender <em>Hebes</em></h2>

                <p>Portland's USDA hardiness zone is Zone 8B, which means that temps don't usually go below 15F (of course we know it does get colder sometimes, but not often). Many of our winters are warmer, and in those years, tender <em>Hebes</em> typically survive and even look great while doing it! For best success, plant tender <em>Hebes</em> in spring or early summer so they can get established well before threatening cold, make sure to keep them watered during dry spells in winter (and summer too), and cross your fingers for a warm winter.</p>

                <p>Because they're so temperamental, we focus on tender <em>Hebes</em> that have exquisite foliage or flowers. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

                        <h2><em>Hebe</em> &lsquo;Amy&rsquo;</h2>

                        <p>Amy is a heartbreaker. Big spikes of vibrant purple flowers and large oblong glossy leaves with purple new growth lure you in.</p>

                        <p>In mild winters it looks great, but our colder winters cause damage to the outer edges (if it's not killed all together).</p>

                        <p>The damaged part has to be cut back so while it may reach the 4'x4' that the labels predict, it will not stay there consistently.</p>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Scrophulariaceae (figwort or foxglove family)</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Hebe</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin</strong>: New Zealand</p>

                        <p><strong>Success with <em>Hebes</em>:</strong> To be happy with <em>Hebes</em>, provide them with a few important things. They need:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Full sun</li>

                            <li>Soil with excellent drainage</li>

                            <li>Mulching once per year</li>

                            <li>Regular watering - <em>Hebes</em> aren't particularly drought tolerant. Many <em>Hebes</em> damaged in winter when temps drop below freezing and there is no precipitation. Dry soil and dry air is very hard on evergreen plants, so make sure to water, even in winter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Drainage in the soil can't be overstated. <em>Hebes</em> are far more likely to suffer in our heavy clay soils, especially in waterlogged winters.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Prune after bloom by cutting back branches that bloomed by half to maintain compact form, as they bloom on new growth. Also a good thinning every couple years keeps Hebe in good shape. They can be rejuvenated by cutting back severely, as they will sprout from old, leafless wood as long as not all the green growth is removed.</p>
