                <p>Gardeners are always on the hunt for really good leaves, and Ninebark is one of the shrubs that gives them to us. Glowing gold or amber, dusky purple or emerald green, <em>Physocarpus</em> offers a rainbow of foliage that is truly garden worthy.</p>

                <p>Ninebarks aren't only about the leaves though. They may be at their best in summer when covered in clusters of white flowers. Berries for birds follow and when the leaves fall off in autumn, they reveal striped bark that peels off in long slivers.</p>

                <p>There are two species that are commonly grown. <em>Physocarpus capitatus</em>, Western Ninebark is native to the Pacific Northwest and is one of our&nbsp;<a href="/natives/physocarpus/">Native Plant Picks.</a></p>

                <p>Eastern Ninebark, <em>Physocarpus opulifolius</em>, is the species <a href="/natives/physocarpus/">covered in this article.</a></p>

                        <h2>Facts: Physocarpus</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae, the Rose family</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Physocarpus (f-eye-zoe-CAR-puss) In Greek, physa means 'bladder' and karpon means fruit, referring to bladder-like fruit.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Ninebark</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Most species are native to North America. Just one, <em>Physocarpus amurensis</em> is native to Korea and Manchuria.</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Clusters of reddish pink flower buds open to white or pale pink flowers in spring. Leaves are alternate, simple, 3-5 lobed, and can be green, purple, red or yellow.</p>

                        <p>Leaves turn yellow, orange or red before falling in autumn to reveal bark peeling in long sinuous pieces. Fall berries are small, seedy and hairy &ndash; great for birds and not bad to look at. Grows upright in a broad fan or fountain shape.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Most are large shrubs, growing 6-10' tall and wide. A few varieties are smaller-growing, to 3-5'.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Physocarpus</em> is very adaptable. Wet soil, dry soil, nutrient rich soil, poor soil, full sun, part shade, <em>Physocarpus</em> is not picky. Some of the purple-leaf types can turn a bit green in summer heat, and gold-leaf types appreciate some afternoon shade or additional water to keep from burning. All <em>Physocarpus</em> are cold tolerant to -30f or colder.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Being a member of the rose family, <em>Physocarpus</em> is prone to some of the same problems. Powdery mildew is the main issue. Interior leaves are first spotted with fuzzy white dots, then often coated with white.</p>

                        <p>Plants with good air circulation that aren't watered heavily in summer are less likely to have issues. Watering the ground beneath the plant rather than the leaves can also help.</p>

                        <p>Early detection is a good control - just pick off the effected leaves when you see it.</p>

                        <p>If that doesn't work, fungicides can help. Serenade is a natural fungicide that used bacteria to fight disease, and is a good preventative.</p>
