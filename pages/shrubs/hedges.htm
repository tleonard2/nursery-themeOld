		       <p><em>&ldquo;I recently moved into a new house, and my neighbors aren't exactly what I dreamed of…What do you have in the way of quite fast growing shrubs for privacy?&rdquo;</em></p>

                    <p class="clear">This is a common question year 'round. Privacy is important! One important thing to consider is that the faster something grows, the more you'll have to manage it. This means sometimes pruning 3 times a year! If you choose something that may take a little longer to fill in, it will require less work in the long term.</p>

						<p><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plants could be placed close enough to fill in a single season, but this may lead to problems down the road from overcrowding. We recommend leaving a minimum of 2 feet between plants. If the plant grows 1 foot per year, space plants four feet apart.</p>

						<p><strong>Timing:</strong> The best time to plant hedge material is in spring for evergreens and fall for deciduous plants. A healthy hedge will take 2 - 3 years to fill in before you get a dense screen. Bamboo will be the same if clumps are planted 5’ apart.</p>

						<p><strong>Planting:</strong> We encourage planting in the cooler part of the day to alleviate st ress on the plants (and the planter). When planting a hedges, amend the soil with 1/3 compost to 2/3 soil. Dig your holes twice as wide as the container and a little deeper. Make sure the sides of the holes are not smooth like the inside of a pot. Tho roughly water the plants after planting.</p>

						<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular water is the primary element of a healthy hedge. We recommend watering slowly for an hour once a week. This is essential for the first and second years while the plants are getting settled. As the plants mature, infrequent, but deep watering in the hottest parts of the year are all that may be needed Fertilizing three times a year can create a screen faster. See the Information Desk for fertilizing and pruning details.</p>
