                <p><em>Coprosma</em> is commonly called mirror plant or looking glass plant for its beautiful, glossy leaves. The foliage can come in a wide array of colors and combinations including pink, burgundy and gold.</p>

                <p><em>Coprosma</em> is a genus which includes ninety species of evergreen shrubs and small trees. These plants are native to grasslands, rocky areas, and forests of Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific Islands. Because they evolved in a much warmer and dryer climate than we have here in the Pacific Northwest, <em>Coprosma</em> is considered borderline hardy here and will need to be protected or moved to a greenhouse for overwintering.</p>

                <p><em>Coprosma</em> is a fairly quick growing plant that makes a great addition to summer and fall containers. It pairs well with fall colored pansies, <em>dahlias</em> with darker foliage such as Mystic Spirit, or the beautifully orange tinted blades of <em>Carex testacea</em>. In protected areas, or in years with a mild winter, mirror plant can add a splashy evergreen evergreen shrub in borders.</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Coprosma</p>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rubiaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Mirror Plant</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Found in forest, swamp, grassland, and rocky areas of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Grows well in many different soil types but needs good drainage. Likes full sun. These plants are borderline hardy in Portland’s climate and will need protection or a greenhouse for overwintering.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Coprosma likes regular watering but does not like soggy soil.
