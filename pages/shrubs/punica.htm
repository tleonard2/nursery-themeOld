                <p>Pomegranates have been in cultivation so long that no one knows exactly where they came from. It has been in use for eons in Iran and India and is featured in Egyptian mythology.</p>
	             <p>Many such exotic plants don't often translate to Portland, but the Pomegranate does. It thrives in our warm summers, reliably gracing our gardens with hot orange flowers, and it stands up to our winter cold.</p>

                <p>Portland summers aren't usually long enough to produce fruit reliably. The variety 'Angel Red' ripens earlier than most pomegranates, and it's our best bet for growing fruit.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Despite a possible lack of fruit, we think that all varieties of Pomegranate are worth growing since the flowers really can't be beat. Site them in the hottest spot in your yard and they'll be happy. In areas that get very windy in winter, plant them in an area where the wind is a bit less.</p>

                        <h3>Portland Nursery has carried many different varieties of Punica over the years. The following varieties are those we commonly stock.</h3>

                        <h2>Facts: Punica</h2>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Punica (POO-ni-kuh)</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Pomegranate</p>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Punicaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Origin is uncertain but is likely Mediterranean to Himalayas. It has been in cultivation for ages.</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Small genus with few species, Punica granatum is most common. Large shrubs or small trees with bright orange, red, pink, peach or yellow flowers in summer and large round red to brown fruit in late summer or fall.</p>

                        <p>In the Pacific Northwest the growing season is typically not long enough to produce edible fruit. Deciduous leaves are commonly green and appear in mid-spring once temperatures have begun to warm. Branches are sometimes thorny.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Large shrubs to about 8-12' are common in our climate. Cold winter weather can cause branch dieback but the plant typically recovers. This limits the mature size to less than California standards (20').</p>

                        <p>Dwarf cultivars grow to about 3-4' x 3-4'.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun sun sun! Pomegranates can grow in the hotest spot in the yard, where other things burn. Reflected heat from white walls and concrete is ideal and improves the possibility of fruit. Raise soil pH by adding lime. Don't be surprised if branches are still bare in early May - they need heat to make leaves - you should see leaves by June though.</p>

                        <p>Hardy Z7b &ndash; Usually fine in Portland but may be tender in windy areas.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Most cultivars will not produce fruit in our climate because our summer heat just doesn't last long enough.</p>

                        <p>The variety 'Angel Red' is the best bet for ripe delicious fruit in Portland.</p>
