                <p>Edgeworthia is one of the stars of the winter garden - or should we say it's one of the suns? Bright yellow flowers appear in round clusters on the branch tips like little suns, so it's not much of a stretch.</p>

                <p>Edgeworthia flowers exude a sweet fragrance similar to Daphne, further enhancing their sunny disposition. During the time that <em>Edgeworthia</em> is not flowering it still impresses, with lush long green tropical-looking leaves.</p>

                <p>There is a bit of yellow fall color (nothing to write home about) in autumn. After leaves have fallen, bare branches host silver-hair covered flower buds that according to one observer, look like mouse toes. <em>Edgeworthia</em> is one of those cool garden plants that collectors love and everyone will ask you about when you add it to your garden.</p>

                <h2><em>Edgeworthia chrysantha vs Edgeworthia papyrifera</em></h2>

                <p>Some literature says that there is no difference between the two species, but we think there is. It appears to us that <em>E. chrysantha</em> has a beefier appearance all around, with dense flower clusters and fat branches that hold flowers upright and don't droop. <em>E. papyrifera</em> is more slender from flowers to branches. Tubular flowers have longer tubes and seem to pale a bit faster, leaves are more slender, branches are thinner and plants tend to drape like a lady on a chaise.</p>

                <p><em>Regarding orange and red flowering <em>Edgeworthias</em> - they are very hard to find, and we are just as sad about it as you are. We keep an eye out and bring them in whenever we find them, but this is rare.</em></p>
