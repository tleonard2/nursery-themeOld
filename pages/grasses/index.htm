			<p>Ornamental grasses are versatile, easy, low-maintenance, and beautiful. Catching the movement of the wind, they bring flow and sway to the garden and, as the seasons change, provide different interest from spring through winter. They add a distinct textural element as well. Their versatility extends from containers to the garden bed.</p>
				<p>In containers, grasses add form and texture, and can serve as a thriller or filler. In the garden, smaller grasses can be massed together and the larger ones can stand alone as a focal point or a screen. Grasses can also be a major component of a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant landscape design or a rain garden.</p>

<h2>Clumping versus Running:</h2>

<p>No need to worry, most ornamental grasses will not take over your yard. Grasses fall into two categories: clumping and running. The running grasses spread by creeping rhizomes to form larger and larger colonies.</p>
<p>The clumping grasses form a clump that will slowly increase in girth over the years. Most ornamental grasses are clumping. Some of these will self-sow, but should not become a nuisance and can be used to your advantage if you are going for a natural look.</p>
