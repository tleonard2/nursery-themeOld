				<h2>Installing a Seed Lawn</h2>
				<h3>Tips for Installing</h3>
				<p>The optimal time to seed a lawn in the Pacific Northwest is between Sept. 1st and Oct. 15; but second best is between April 15th and June 15th.</p>

				<ol>
				<li>Calculate the square footage of space for your new lawn. To figure square footage, simply multiply the length and width.</li>
				<li>Examine the amount of light the area receives. There are seed mixes for every kind of situation. Shade, sun, high traffic, water conservation, and environmentally sound seeds are now available.</li>
				<li>Prepare your soil for the seed (or sod).
				<ul>
                        <li>Roto-till when the soil is not too wet.</li>

                        <li>Add compost to help increase drainage (air and water flow) through the soil.</li>

                        <li>Add lime to raise the pH level, 5lbs. per 100 square feet</li>

                        <li>Use the roto-tiller to blend lime and compost</li>
				</ul>

				</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Equipment Needed</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Rototiller</li>
					<li>Steel Lawn Rake</li>
					<li>Drop Spreader</li>
					<li>Water Roller</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Portland Nursery has lawn rakes, rollers, and spreaders available for use with a refundable deposit. Please call ahead to be sure they are available for use.</p>
					<p>Rototillers can be rented at any equipment rental store.</p>

				<h2>Steps for Seeding a Lawn</h2>
					<h3>Remove old turf</h3>
					<p>There are a couple of ways to remove old or unwanted turf.</p>
					<p>Sheet mulching the entire area in the spring or fall will slowly smother out the turf underneath. This leaves an area ready to dig in organic matter and prepared for seeding.</p>
					<p>A quicker option is to use a non-selective herbicide. There are chemical and natural options and should be applied 2-3 weeks ahead of time when the air temps are between 50-80 degrees. Once the grass is dead, rototill no deeper than 6" and hand remove any large clumps that won't break up. </p>
					<p>This is also a good time to add amendments such as lime and compost.</p>
					<h3>Level the bed and sow seed</h3>
					<p>Use a steel lawn rake to even out the soil and remove stones. This will help attain a flat surface and will provide superior germination results. Add lime, 50# per 1000 sq. ft to sweeten the soil. Sprinkle over area to be seeded and rake into the surface.</p>
					<p>Divide the seed into two lots. Using a drop spreader, distribute the first lot, then distribute the second lot at right angles to the first. In smaller areas, this can be done by using a handheld spreader or by hand. When using a drop spreader, make sure the edges are touched up by hand.</p>
					<h3>Rake in seed and roll</h3>
					<p>Lightly rake the entire area to ensure good contact between the seed and soil. The depth of the seed should be between 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Use a water roller, to compact the entire area. This will help the seed assimilate more water and quicken germination time.</p>
					<h3>Add mulch or compost</h3>
					<p>This will also speed up germination and keep the birds from eating seed. If the area is on a slope, this will help keep the seed in place and prevent erosion. The mulch should be spread thin enough to see the soil underneath.</p>
					<h3>Water thoroughly</h3>
					<p>Sown lawns must be kept constantly moist. Thoroughly soak the area after planting to a depth of 6 inches. Water by hand two to three times a day. This should be done more often when itâ€™s hot and/or windy, and should be applied using a fine spray so that the seed is not disturbed. It is important to keep the area free of any traffic for at least 6-8 weeks.</p>
					<p>Only after this period of time should gentle mowing commence. The soil will be soft and the grass will be more delicate than an established lawn.</p>

					                        <p>Knowing what a lawn likes goes a long way to creating that great looking patch of green.</p>

					                        <ul>
					                            <li>Soil pH of 6.5-7</li>

					                            <li><strong>Lime 5lbs. per 100 square feet, twice a year.</strong>  Our rainy climate leaves soil with a low pH, making it hard for lawn grass to pick up the nutrition it needs to thrive. Raise the pH by adding lime twice a year and your lawn will be much healthier.Lawn</li>

					                            <li><strong>Water 1&quot; per week</strong> In summer, watering this much will allow the lawn to go dormant, which is healthy. Letting the lawn grow taller in hot summer months, 3-4&quot; keeps it looking greener.</li>

					                            <li><strong>Fertilize 3x per yea</strong>r with organic fertilizer or 4x per year with synthetic fertilizer. Start in March, finish in September.</li>
					                        </ul>
