                <p><em>Malus fusca</em> (syn. <em>Malus diversifolia</em>, <em>Pyrus fusca</em>) is our only native crabapple – easily discernible from its east coast cousins by the oblong shape of the fruit – and is a good large shrub/small tree for attracting birds to the garden.</p>

                <p>One of its advantages to gardeners in this region is its tolerance of heavy clay soils and winter wet weather – it would be a good candidate to plant at a bioswale or disconnected downspout. Its abilities as a “wetlander” give it an important edge over showier crabapples in certain settings.</p>

                <p>Once established, it isn’t adverse to drier conditions in the summertime, so its love of wetter situations doesn’t have to be maintained year-round. Full sun suits it best, but it is tolerant of partial shade (though fruit production might diminish a bit with less sun).</p>

                <p>This crabapple will grow as a multi-stemmed shrub or attractive small tree – in any case it may require some pruning if it tends to start to form a (undesirable) thicket – suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>

                <p>What are mistaken for thorns along the stem are actually spurs from which the flowers and later fruit emerge, not nearly as sharp as they appear (but do serve as a protection to smaller birds).</p>

                <p>In April – May, small clusters of fragrant white to pink simple flowers appear, followed by clusters of tiny fruit of yellow to reddish purple which often persist into the winter, providing late-season food for a variety of birds. The fruit is edible by humans, though it is quite sour; any jam or jelly would require the addition of considerable sugar to make it palatable.</p>
