	    			<p>Known both as <em>C. sericea</em> and <em>C. stolonifera</em>, our native Red Osier or Red Twig Dogwood is one of our most beautiful shrubs and is ideal for the wetter parts of your garden. </p>

			<p>The outstanding red winter stem color that gives this plant its name and distinct beauty is only one, albeit the most dramatic, of its virtues; it is, in fact, a plant with four-season interest and great wildlife value.</p>

<p>Mid-spring to summer finds this shrub in bloom – frothy white clusters of tiny flowers ride the ends of the branches, giving way to white or bluish white berry-like fruits that are not particularly appetizing to the human palate, but that will draw birds to your garden in numbers, and are also a striking contrast to the stems and the foliage – which in the fall, turns various shades of red to red-orange, making it a blaze of color.</p>

			<p>Red Twig Dogwoods need plenty of space. Horizontal stems at the base of the plant root when nodes come into contact with the ground, and form a thicket. This ability, along with its berries, make it an excellent habitat plant for birds, providing both food and shelter. It also provides a quickly-established hedgerow and potential screening plant.</p>
			<p>If you don’t want it to spread as readily, keep it in a partially shady spot with more “normal” garden water and prune out the rooting horizontal branches.</p>

	                    <h2>Facts: Cornus</h2>

<p><strong>Family:</strong> Cornaceae</p>

		                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Cornus</p>

		                <p><strong>Common:</strong> Red Twig Dogwood, Red Osier Dogwood</p>

		                <p><strong>Native Range:</strong> Low to mid-elevations throughout most of North America, along streams, in floodplains and boggy areas, moist to wet woodlands.</p>

		                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Multi-stemmed shrub 3-15&rsquo; tall and wide, spreading by horizontal branches at the base rooting at points of contact with the ground; thicket-forming, with newest branches the bright red that is its main feature.</p>

		                <p>Opposite, oval/ovate leaves; clusters of small white flowers, followed by white to bluish berries favored by birds. Leaves turn red in the fall, bare red branches providing colorful contrast in winter.</p>

		                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Full sun to shade (performs better with at least some sun). Much prefers moist to wet conditions, can tolerate seasonal flooding. (That being said, it is also known to be tolerant of drier to more normal garden moisture conditions, especially if given some shade.)</p>
						<p>For optimal red twig color, prune out old wood in early spring to encourage fresh growth.
						<p><strong>Size:</strong> Grows 10-15’ x 12-15’. Forms a thicket by spreading along the ground, so allow plenty of space.</p>

		                <p><strong>Pests/Diseases:</strong> Can be susceptible to a variety of fungal diseases but they are typically minor.
