	<p>In the Pacific Northwest, we are fortunate to be home to a lush green environment with a wide variety of plant species, rich in color, texture and local history.</p>

<p>Pacific Northwest native plants are not just beautiful, they are functional too. Planting natives is the best place to start when the goal is restoring ecosystems, attracting wildlife and supporting pollinators. </p>

<p>Northwest plants, animals and insects have lived together for thousands of years, so it’s no surprise that our native critters prefer the familiar. Adding trees to support insects and caterpillars will bring birds. Using native perennials will bring butterflies and almost all native plants have a role in supporting pollinators.</p>

                    <p>We have compiled a LIST OF NORTHWEST NATIVE PLANTS that you can download: <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/native-plants/NorthwestNativePlantList.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>Northwest Native Plant List</a>. This is a list of the plants you are likely to find at the nursery at some time during the year. </p>

                    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> it's a good idea to call for availability, for it can vary from year to year and even within a single season.</em></p>
