                <p>One of the loveliest of our native wildflowers has got to be <em>Sidalcea</em>, or checker mallow.</p>

                <p>It is truly a cheery sight in late spring through early summer, the tall stems of delicate hollyhock-like blossoms of white to rosy pink standing tall in the sunny border of the garden, actively visited by both bees and butterflies. Of the two dozen or so species of <em>Sidalcea</em> native to western North America, about ten are native to Oregon.</p>

                <p>There are species that make their home along the coast and on each side of the Cascades, so there are checker-mallows suitable for a range of garden conditions. For the most part, they are best in a full sun to partial shade location. Most are also happiest with moist to wet, well-drained soil (some will tolerate hotter/drier conditions too, if they're given a bit more shade, or extra attention with supplemental watering).</p>

                <p>Bees and butterflies will enjoy your <em>Sidalcea;</em> some species are beneficial as host plants for the caterpillars of a few of our native butterflies, an added plus. To have enough for you and for the caterpillars to enjoy, they are fairly easy to propagate from seed (see side bar).</p>

                <h3>Here's a selection of <em>Sidalceas:</em></h3>

                        <p>Possibly the most versatile checker mallow for the garden. Blooms late spring to early summer. Flowers white with light pink to pink. Prefers full sun to light shade, and well-drained moist to rather dry soil (give more water in hotter/drier areas).</p>

                        <p>Grows 2-6 feet. Easily propagated by seed.</p>

                        <p>Found only in open, riparian sites (river banks) in western Oregon. Rose-pink petals deepen in color as they age. Grows to 5 feet. Thrives in full sun to partial shade and consistent watering.</p>

                        <p>A particular favorite of butterflies.</p>

                        <p>Inhabits tidal marshes and wet coastal meadows. However, can be successfully grown in gardens on both sides of the Cascades. Beautiful addition to a moist/wet wildflower garden.</p>

                        <p><em>Sidalcea campestris</em> and <em>Sidalcea cusickii</em> are commonly available and typically stocked May-August. </p>
	                        <p>The other species are not readily available in the nursery trade, but if we see some weâ€™ll get some and they would be stocked in the May-August time-frame.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Sidalcea</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Malvaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Sidlacea</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> checker mallow</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Western North America</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Basel clumps of lobed leaves, with those on the flowering stems often more finely dissected. Flowers are in white to pink clusters at the top of the stems, resembling delicate hollyhocks.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Most checker mallows will grow well in full sun to partial shade, in moist to wet or sometimes drier conditions, depending on species.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Regular water and well-drained soil. Deadhead spent flowers to promote bloom. Cut plant back down to the basal rosette of leaves in the autumn.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests &amp; Diseases:</strong> If grown in conditions too wet with too little air circulation, leaf-spot or rust can occur. Otherwise, does not seem to be especially bothered by any pests or diseases</p>

                        <p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Native checker mallow can be grown from seed collected in the late summer or early fall, either sown directly in the garden or in flats that are left outside to chill for several weeks. Seeds will germinate in the following spring.</p>
