                <p>There are over 200 species of <em>Asclepias</em> worldwide, and more than 70 of those native to North America; about a half-dozen can be found in parts of Oregon. It is highly useful as both a nectar plant for adult butterflies and as a food source for the growing caterpillars.</p><img class="pull-right img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/asclepias/monarch-caterpillar.jpg" alt="monarch-caterpillar">

                <p>The milky substance in the stem and leaves of the plant that give it its common name contains a chemical compound that, when ingested by the caterpillar, acts as a repellant to predators.And some species of the plant are more compatible with specific species of butterflies, in terms of their protective qualities.</p>

                <p>This is especially true for the Monarch butterfly and <em>Asclepias speciosa</em>, as it is the only food source for the Monarch caterpillars!</p>

                <p>As habitat in the wild is lost to development, maintaining compatible food and nectar supplies for butterflies becomes even more important.</p><a title="Kenneth Dwain Harrelson [GFDL (https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AMonarch_In_May.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Monarch_In_May.jpg/1024px-Monarch_In_May.jpg" alt="Monarch In May"></a>

                <p class="clear">Besides their usefulness as a butterfly plant, the milkweeds are also beautiful. Leaves broad or thin, standing generally 2-3 feet tall (sometimes taller), with rounded clusters of tiny flowers that look like small stars, often in a mixture of creamy white and pink, sometimes deepening to a rich purple.</p>

                <p><em>Asclepias</em> requires excellent drainage and a mostly- to full-sun location; yellowing leaves indicate either too much water or poor drainage. Too much retained water can also result in root rot.</p>

                <p>But in general, all species of butterfly weed are virtually pest and disease-free (if you notice the leaves on your plant are being eaten, you may have successfully attracted butterflies to your garden!).</p>

                        <h2><em>Asclepias speciosa</em>: Showy milkweed</h2>

                        <p>Showy milkweed grows through the Willamette Valley and is the most commonly available Asclepias in nurseries. It also hosts Monarch butterflies at every stage of development! In addition, the nectar provided by its flowers is popular with hummingbirds, bees and other types of butterflies.</p>

                        <p>Pink flowers bloom from late spring to mid-summer. Blue-green lance-shape leaves are up to 6" long and have a thin layer of white fuzz. Showy milkweed adapts to conditions on both sides of the Cascades, but good soil drainage is important.</p>

                        <p>Long, narrow leaves in whorls up the stems of this 2.5&rsquo; milkweed. Flowers are generally purplish-pink and white. It grows in dry to moist soil, near streams and at the coast &mdash; but note, in sandy (fast-draining) soil.</p>

                        <p>Elongated heart-shaped leaves, purple flowers arranged in more open, drooping umbels. This one is found in the dry spots of southern Oregon and into California. Extremely drought-tolerant once established, requires next-to-no summer water.</p>

					<h2>Facts: Asclepias</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Asclepiadaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Asclepias</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> milkweed, butterfly weed</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> mostly open, moist to dry, rocky areas, low to mid elevation, throughout the region</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Leaves opposite or whorled, on flowering stems 2-3 feet in height. Flowers are unusually formed clusters of five reflexed, fused petals and sepals that give them a star-like appearance. Color is a combination of white to pink to purple. Stems and leaves contain a milky sap that gives the plant its common name. Caution: most species of this plant is poisonous to humans.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Milkweed thrives in full sun to light shade, and requires very well-drained soil. Grows and spread by underground rhizomes. It is an excellent choice for a butterfly meadow or rock garden.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests/Diseases:</strong> pests and diseases generally not a problem. Yellowing leaves is a sign of over-water or insufficient drainage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Important note: The chemical compounds in milkweed sap can cause dermatitis if it contacts the skin, and the plant is considered poisonous to humans.</strong></p>

                        <h2>Amazing Monarch Butterflies:</h2>

                        <p>Every autumn millions of Monarch butterflies undertake a 3000-mile migration from Canada and northern United States south into far southern California and Mexico to spend the winter where temperatures are warmer and food sources abundant. Northwest writer Robert Pyle wrote a book about this amazing annual phenomena, called <a href="https://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780618127436-3" target="_blank">Chasing Monarchs</a>.</p>

                        <p>Here is more information about <em>Asclepias</em> and its relationship with Monarch butterflies, as well as about the annual migration:</p>
