   <p>The wild fruit of the Pacific Northwest  offers a variety of fresh and delicious flavors. They can be used alone or combined with  other fruit for a unique twist in your favorite jam, sauce or baking recipes. </p>
		   <p>Include these plants in your &lsquo;edible forest&rsquo; or general  landscape, and have a bounty that you can both enjoy and share with the birds  that visit your garden!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a  sampling:</p>

		   <h4>Rosa spp. (Rose)</h4>
		   <p>Rose hips are well known for their abundance of vitamin C and use in making delicious jam. Our native roses are no exception!</p>

               <img src="../images/vaccinium/natives/vaccinium_parvifolium150a.jpg" alt="Vaccinium spp." width="150" height="150" class="left" />
               <h4>Vaccinium spp. (Huckleberry)</h4>
               <p>Perhaps the best of the native berries is the Evergreen Huckleberry (<em>V. ovatum</em>); not found as commonly in nurseries, the Black Huckleberry (<em>V. membranaceum</em>) is also really tasty; the Red Huckleberry (<em>V. parvifolium</em>) is sometimes found to be a little sour, but easily cultivated and still delicious with some sweetening. </p>

               <img src="../images/amelanchier/Amelanchier_alnifolia150.jpg" alt="Amelanchier alnifolia" width="150" height="159" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Amelanchier alnifolia </em>(Serviceberry)</h4>
               <p>These tiny berries were a staple of Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, and can be eaten fresh, cooked or dried. In addition, this small tree / tall multi-stemmed shrub is attractive with something of interest every season of the year, so is garden-worthy in its own right. The birds will be happy to enjoy the fruit, too.</p>
               <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> <a href="http://www.boskydellnatives.com/serviceberrypie.htm" target="_blank">Serviceberry Pie</a></p>
               <hr />
               <img src="../images/fragaria/fragaria150.jpg" alt="Fragaria vesca" width="150" height="215" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Fragaria spp.</em> (Strawberry)</h4>
               <p>All three of our native  strawberries <em>(F. vesca, F. chiloensis, F.  virginiana)</em> are pleasantly edible, the latter two being two of the parents  of today&rsquo;s garden strawberries.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>In all cases the fruit is quite small, so having an abundance for a recipe might be a challenge unless you have a lot of space, but for fresh eating while out in your garden, they&rsquo;re hard to beat.</p>

               <hr />
               <img src="../images/rubus/red-salmonberry-wiki150.jpg" alt="Rubus" width="150" height="167" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Rubus spp.</em></h4>
               <p>Salmonberry <em>(R. spectabilis) </em>and Thimbleberry <em>(R. parviflora)</em> vary in flavor depending  on the growing site.&nbsp; Thimbleberry has the sometimes advantage of growing in drier conditions, while Salmonberry requires moist conditions to thrive. Both are edible raw: Thimbleberries more reliably sweet; Salmonberries are sweet but sometimes bland in taste. Both are also made into jams and jellies and sauces.</p>

		       <img src="../images/sambucus/sambucus_caeruleaWiki150.jpg" alt="Sambucus racemosa" width="150" height="181" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Sambucus ssp.</em> (Elderberry) </h4>
               <p>Both the Blue Elderberry <em>(S. cearulea) </em>and  Red Elderberry <em>(S. racemosa)</em> are  edible and widely used, but as there is controversy and disagreement about fresh eating, <strong>be sure</strong> to cook the  fruit before eating <em>(also note that all  parts of the plant other than the fruit are highly toxic).</em> Used for jams and jellies and baked goods &ndash; the blue elderberry can also be turned into a delicious cordial.</p>

               <img src="../images/salal/gaultheria-shallon-osu150.jpg" alt="Gaultheria shallon" width="150" height="168" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Gaultheria shallon</em> (Salal)</h4>
               <p>When fully ripe the berries are  sweet and are often mixed with other native berries for jellies and jams. It has plenty of natural pectin for setting the jelly/jam, too.</p>

		   <h3>The following natives have edible fruit, but definitely need  to be sweetened or mixed with sweeter fruit - they&rsquo;re much too tart to eat  alone:</h3>
		    <hr />
               <img class="left" src="../images/viburnum/viburnum-trilobum150.jpg" alt="viburnum-trilobum150" width="151" height="153">
               <h4><em>Viburnum trilobum</em> <br />(American Cranberry Bush)</h4>
               <p>The plentiful fruit, quite tart when fresh, is high in vitamin C. Tasty when cooked and used like you would cranberries - in sauces, condiments, jams and jellies.</p>

               <hr />
               <img src="../images/mahonia/mahonia_aquifolium2_wiki150.jpg" alt="Mahonia aquifolium" width="150" height="158" class="left" />
               <h4><em>Mahonia aquifolium</em> (Oregon Grape)</h4>
               <p>Berries tend to be tart, so  are made into jellies and jams with sweeter berries (and/or lots of sugar).</p>

               <img class="left" src="../images/malus/malus-fusca150.jpg" alt="malus-fusca150" width="150" height="163" />
               <h4><em>Malus fusca</em> (Western Crabapple) </h4>
               <p>Edible but tart (again, think  jam, where you add lots of sugar). Raw seeds are considered toxic and should be discarded.</p>

               <hr />
               <img class="left" src="../images/prunus/prunus-virginiana150.jpg" alt="prunus-virginiana150" width="150" height="191" />
               <h4><em>Prunus virginiana</em> (Chokecherry) </h4>
               <p>Also in the category of edible but tart, these fruits carry a lot of juice and natural pectin and are used to make delicious jellies and pies. Note: Though they are edible and nutritious, the seeds contain small amounts of hydrogen cyanide &ndash; usually in too small a quantity to cause harm &ndash; but please be aware that ANY extremely bitter seeds or fruit should not be eaten.</p>
               <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> <a href="http://www.grit.com/food/recipes/chokecherry-jelly-recipe.aspx" target="_blank">Chokecherry Jam</a></p>

               <hr />
               <img class="left" src="../images/crataegus/crataegus-douglassii150.jpg" alt="crataegus-douglassii150" width="150" height="158" />
               <h4><em>Crataegus douglassii</em> (Black Hawthorne) </h4>
               <p>Edible but with a slightly mealy texture, these berries are also high in pectin, making them a superb thickening agent for those homemade jams and jellies. They are also used in pies and tarts. Beware of the cherry-sized pit, if eating them fresh!</p>

<p>Attracting butterflies to your garden requires more time and patience than attracting birds. There are also considerations of placement of plants and providing a water source. Below are some links that should go a long way to helping you set up a garden area attractive to butterflies:</p>

<p>Lists for <a href="http://www.naba.org/chapters/nabaes/btrfly-gdng3.html" target="_blank"></a> and <a href="http://www.naba.org/chapters/nabaes/btrfly-gdng4.html" target="_blank">Native Nectar Plants from the Eugene Chapter of the North American Butterfly Association.</a></p>

<p>Local photographer Chris Carvalho has put together a thorough (and beautiful) <a href="http://www.lensjoy.com/butterfly_plant_list.htm" target="_blank">resource on native butterflies and the plants that feed them.</a> (He includes a few compatible non-natives here, too).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portlandnursery.com/docs/birds-deer-bees/Butterfly-Gardening.pdf" target="_blank">Our brochure on gardening for butterflies</a> lists more natives along with non-natives, and designates whether the plant is for nectar-feeding or larval-feeding.</p>
