                <p>The wild fruit of the Pacific Northwest offers a variety of fresh and delicious flavors. They can be used alone or combined with other fruit for a unique twist in your favorite jam, sauce or baking recipes.</p>

                <p>Include these plants in your ‘edible forest’ or general landscape, and have a bounty that you can both enjoy and share with the birds that visit your garden!&nbsp; Here’s a sampling:</p>

                        <p>Perhaps the best of the native berries is the <em>Vaccinium ovatum:</em> Evergreen Huckleberry; not found as commonly in nurseries, the <em>Vaccinium membranaceum:</em> Black Huckleberry is also really tasty; the <em>Vaccinium parvifolium:</em> Red Huckleberry is sometimes found to be a little sour, but easily cultivated and still delicious with some sweetening.</p>

                        <p>These tiny berries were a staple of Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, and can be eaten fresh, cooked or dried. In addition, this small tree / tall multi-stemmed shrub is attractive with something of interest every season of the year, so is garden-worthy in its own right. The birds will be happy to enjoy the fruit, too.</p>

                        <p>All three of our native strawberries <em>Fragaria vesca, Fragaria chiloensis, Fragaria virginiana</em> are pleasantly edible, the latter two being two of the parents of today&rsquo;s garden strawberries.</p>

                        <p>In all cases the fruit is quite small, so having an abundance for a recipe might be a challenge unless you have a lot of space, but for fresh eating while out in your garden, they&rsquo;re hard to beat.</p>

                        <p><em>Rubus spectabilis:</em> Salmonberry and <em>Rubus parviflora:</em> Thimbleberry vary in flavor depending on the growing site. Thimbleberry has the sometimes advantage of growing in drier conditions, while Salmonberry requires moist conditions to thrive. Both are edible raw: Thimbleberries more reliably sweet; Salmonberries are sweet but sometimes bland in taste. Both are also made into jams and jellies and sauces</p>
