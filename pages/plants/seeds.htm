                        <p>Year round vegetable gardening is a treat &amp; success hinges heavily on getting the plants in the ground at the appropriate time.</p>

                        <p>We've addressed the what-to-plant-when in our handy <a href="../../docs/veggies/VeggieCalendar.pdf" target="_blank">Veggie Planting Calendar</a>. It provides a rough guideline for when to start your seeds and set out your transplant starts.</p>

                        <p>It is easy to fill up your whole garden in one day, but, we want to remind you to save some space for replanting fast maturing crops (such as lettuce) for a continual harvest. This practice is commonly referred to as &quot;succession planting&quot;</p>

                        <p><img class="left" src="../../images-layout/pdficon.gif" alt="pdficon" width="35" height="33">Refer to our <a href="../../docs/veggies/succession-planting.pdf" target="_blank">Succession Planting Guide</a> for tips and the lists of what-to-plant-when to maximize the harvest season by continually planting new areas of varieties that will ripen sequentially.</p>
