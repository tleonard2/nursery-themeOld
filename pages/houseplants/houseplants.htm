                        <h2><em>Aglaonema:</em> Chinese Evergreen</h2>

                        <p>An excellent foliage plant suitable for both low light and bright indirect light situations. It requires very little watering and likes to be root-bound. Considered a Clean Air Plant, which means it reduces common pollutants from the air. Leaves are typically wide and long, slightly oval and coming to a point. But the many varieties can be quite variable in shape, size, color, and pattern. They are slow-growing, easy care (let dry in between waterings), and great air purifiers.</p>

	                        <p>Epiphytes attach themselves to nooks in trees in order to be best exposed to light and water but they are not parasitic. In fact, in their native environment, insects and some frogs sustain life in the funnels of <em>Aechmea</em> leaves.</p>

                        <p>Rubber plant, Ficus elastic, lends an architectural presence to any room with its wide elliptical, rubbery leaves which are also effective in purifying the air. The rubber plant holds on to its leaves more easily than other Ficus species, and although the rubber plant grows best in bright light situations, it is more easily able to adapt to moderate light conditions than its weeping fig or fiddle leaf fig counterparts. The foliage of the most common variety ‘Burgundy’ is bold and dark, and the variegated leaves of other varieties offer lighter contrasting colors.</p>

                        <p>Our most popular floor plant. It does have some challenges for success. First and foremost is needs high light from an unobstructed south/west facing window or supplemental lighting. If you have had one of these in the past and it dropped most of its leaves and put out long weak wimpy growth it was most likely due to not enough light. Fertilize regularly and keep evenly most, not too wet. Keep on the tighter side in its pot.</p>

                        <p><em>Ficus benjamina</em> likes very bright light and evenly moist soil conditions. Do not over water. They do not like cold drafts. Plan on a major leaf drop about 3-4 weeks after you bring this plant home. It is balancing itself to the light you are providing. It is possible for the plant to cast all of its leaves in this process. Give it time and light and it should put the leaves back on . Fertilize year round with a general houseplant food.</p>

                    <h2><a href="/houseplants/tillandsia/"><em>Tillandsia xerographica</em></a></h2>

                    <p>A beautiful airplant species native to the southern Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, where they grow in tree canopies and on rocks. Wide curly leaves of the silver <em>Tillandsia xerographica</em> whirl into a sculptural rosette and serve as a perfect focal point in a well lit room. They flourish in bright indirect light and appreciate good air circulation and a weekly soak in water.</p>

                    <p>Most <em>Tillandsia</em> need high light and a misting or regular soaking (after soaking turn upside down to drain). If plant starts to disintegrate it is most-likely due to lack of water. A good resource we sell is the book "Airplants: The Curious World of Tillandsias".</p>

                    <h2><em>Zamioculcas zamiifolia</em></h2>

                    <p>ZZ plant, short for Zamioculcas zamiifolia, is a stylish upright plant with thick arcing stems of dark glossy leaves. Like the snake plant—also ever popular for its ease of care—zz plants are suitable in low light situations and can go long periods in between watering. They are perfect for greening up areas of the house where window light doesn’t reach so well, and they perform on a once-a-month watering regime.</p>
