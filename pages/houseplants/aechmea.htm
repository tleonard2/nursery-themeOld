                <p>Native to Central and South America, <em>Aechmea fasciata</em> is a beautiful bromeliad with a sculptural form that looks great shown off as a specimen plant in the home. Tough and easy to care for, it is one of our houseplant picks of the month.</p>

                <p><em>Aechmeas</em> are epiphytes belonging to the bromeliad family. Epiphytes attach themselves to nooks in trees in order to be best exposed to light and water but they are not parasitic. In fact, in their native environment, insects and some frogs sustain life in the funnels of <em>Aechmea</em> leaves.</p>

                <p>Once mature, showy pink bracts unfurl under tiny purple flowers that hold their color for a long period of time. Plants flower once and then slowly die, however, they also produce offshoots that can be removed. Simply tug or cut off the offshoots to create new plants and allow the cycle to continue.</p>
