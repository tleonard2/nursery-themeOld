                <p>Colorful and lush, Cymbidiums make dramatically beautiful houseplants. They&rsquo;re among the easiest orchids to grow indoors, reliably producing flower spikes covered with up to 30 blossoms, each 2-5 inches across and lasting 8 weeks or more. They are available in a wide range of fantastic color combinations.</p>

                <p>They appreciate being placed outside in a semi-shaded area after the danger of frost has passed. They can be left outdoors throughout the warmer season and well into the autumn. Be sure to bring the plant back inside in the fall before there is any danger of frost. This will help ensure bountiful re-bloom year after year!</p>

                        <h2>Facts: cymbidium-orchid</h2>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong>  Cymbidiums are naturally found at higher altitudes in temperate mid-Asia through southeast Asia and extending as far south as Australia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Water:</strong>  Water thoroughly with room temperature water during active growth (March through October). Once per week is usually adequate except during the hottest months when an extra drenching to cool and replenish is appreciated.</p>

                        <p><strong>Light:</strong>  Very bright indirect light year-round.  Close to an east facing window is ideal. However, partial shade while blooming will prevent darker colored flowers from fading.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fertilizer:</strong>  Give a dilute, balanced liquid fertilizer every other watering January through July.  Fertilize once a month the rest of the year.</p>

                        <p><strong>Soil:</strong>  A free-draining, moisture retentive, slightly acidic terrestrial orchid mix is best. Repot every few years after blooming but only when pseudo-bulbs are crowded against the pot edges. Cymbidiums bloom better when somewhat potbound</p>

                        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong>  Will tolerate a wide range of temperatures but must habe cool nights (45-60 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout the summer and fall to initiate flower bud set. A drop of about 25 degrees between day and nighttime temperatures is also very helpful in setting blooms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Humidity:</strong>  All orchids appreciate extra humidity.  Place the pot on a pebble tray or near water to increase the ambient moisture.  Misting the foliage often will also help a bit.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pests/ Diseases</strong>:  Cymbidiums are not especially susceptible to any problems but are sometimes attacked by scale or spider mites.</p>

                        <p>Increasing humidity will help keep mites away. Bacterial and fungal problems can be avoided by giving the plants adequate space and airflow and also by watering and misting early in the morning so they can be dry by nightfall.</p>
