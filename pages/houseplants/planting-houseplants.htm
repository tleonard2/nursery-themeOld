               <h2>Supplies:</h2>
			   <ul>
				   <li>A new houseplant.</li>
					<li>A pot that is one size larger than the container the plant is in currently – no more than a 2” increase in diameter. The pot should have drain holes. If the container does not have drain holes, drill them or ask us if we can do it for you. Do not put gravel or rocks in the bottom of the pot. This raises the water table causing rot.</li>

					<li>Tools – gloves, tongs, chopsticks, pruners and a trowel are all good to have on hand depending on what you’re potting.</li>
					<li>Fresh potting soil that suits your new houseplant’s needs. There are a lot of ideas about what constitutes perfect soil blends for specific plants (try googling ‘best potting soils’ and see what you get) – this is a basic chart based on soils we usually stock, and our staffs’ experiences growing in these soils.</li>

	                <h2>Directions:</h2>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Remove the plant from its current pot:</strong> Be gentle! Pull the leaves up and grasp the plant at the base of its stems. Squeeze the sides of the pot gently to help the roots disengage from the sides. Tongs come in handy when potting cacti.</li>
							<li><strong>Loosen the roots:</strong> Roots should fan out from the center of the plant. Gently tease roots apart. If the plant is root-bound (roots are a dense mass), you may need to make a few cuts in the bottom of the root ball and pull them apart. Remember, roots should fan out toward the sides of the container.</li>
							<li><strong>Add potting mix:</strong> Add a layer of potting mix in the bottom of the pot. Remember, do not put rocks in the bottom of the pot!</li>
							<li><strong>Place the plant in the pot:</strong> Set the plant in the center of the pot with the base just below the edge of the container. Add 	potting mix around the edges until the soil space is full and the plant is secure. Use chop sticks or fingers to fill empty pockets with soil. The soil level should cover the roots, but not pile up around the base of the stems. Don’t pack the soil too tightly, and leave room at the top edge of the container for water to accumulate before it soaks into the soil.</li>
							<li><strong>Water the plant:</strong> Water the plant in a sink, soaking it thoroughly. Allow water to drain through the holes in the bottom of the pot. Make sure the surface of the potting soil is even – if soil sinks down and depressions form on the surface, add more soil and water again.</li>
						</ol>
