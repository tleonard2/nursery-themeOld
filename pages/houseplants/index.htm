<p>We love our plants in our gardens and in our homes. We carry a wide range of houseplants including Bonsai, orchids, cacti and succulents. </p>

                    <p>The world of houseplants is often full of surprises. When your outdoor garden is asleep, brighten the gray days with houseplants. Tending indoor plants is a great way to keep your green thumb happy. If you have a love of tropical, unusual, exotic plants that can't possibly survive outdoors in our climate, you can make a home for some of these beauties inside your home.</p>

                    <p>From <em>Aloe</em> to <em>Zygopetalum</em>, we cover the alphabet with choices for your home or office; plants for your brightest window or your darkest corner, those that will love the humidity near your shower or prefer a dry, sunny spot. Orchids, succulents, indoor bonsai and cactus. We have them all.</p>

                    <p>At our <a href="/about/locations/">Division store</a>, we offer you a huge greenhouse just for our tropicals, another area for cacti and succulents and a broad conservatory area stocked with every other houseplant you'd ever want! If you don't find what you like, ask us!</h4>

                    <p>You'll find our featured houseplants below. We carry a great wealth of plants at both of our locations and this is only a brief list. If you are interested in Bonsai, be sure to visit our special <a href="/houseplants/bonsai/">Bonsai Feature Page.</a></p>
