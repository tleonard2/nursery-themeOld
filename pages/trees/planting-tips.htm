                <p>September marks the beginning of the autumn planting season.</p>

                <p>While it is possible to plant trees and shrubs in the heat of summer, it is often easier on the plant if you wait until the temperatures cool somewhat in September or October. Also, if you have clay soil it is often easier to dig in after the first significant shower of the autumn.</p>

                <p>We always stock up on conifers this time of year. Many of these are quite unusual and this is the only time of year that we get some of them. Be sure to stop by frequently to see what we have in new arrivals.</p>

                <h3>We've included a few planting tips for you this month:</h3>

                <h2>Planting &amp; Fertilizing</h2>

                <p>Dig a hole about twice the size of the root-ball and slightly deeper. Drainage issues can be helped by mixing pumice thoroughly into planting soil. Add organic fertilizer to hole and mix slightly. Always follow application rates on the fertilizer box, as the amount needed varies depending on the fertilizer you choose.</p>

                <p><img class="pull-left" alt="tree planting" src="https://portlandnursery.com/newsletter/images/tree-sale-features/treeplanting.jpg">Carefully remove the tree from container and loosen roots. If there are large, circling roots open them up – roots should be spreading out, away from the trunk.</p>

                <p>Lower tree into hole. Set tree in hole at the same level as it was in the pot. If there is a graft (swollen point where trunk and roots join) it should remain at least 2” above ground. A buried graft may rot, killing the tree. Just ask us if you are not sure whether your tree is grafted.</p>

                <p>Gently but firmly backfill soil mixture into hole. If soil is dry, fill hole halfway and then water tree. After it drains, backfill with remaining soil and water slowly and thoroughly. Be sure not to pile soil around the base of the trunk.</p>

                <h2>Mulch! Mulch! Mulch!</h2>

                <p>Mulching is important! Mulch is a layer of organic matter that sits on the surface of the soil. It keeps soil wetter and cooler in summer, drier and warmer in winter, and it helps to keep weeds at bay.</p>

                <p>Cover the root zone with a 1-2” layer of mulch after planting. Use mulch to make a reservoir to keep water from running off by mounding a ring of mulch in a circle about 12-18” away from the trunk.</p>

                <h2>Staking</h2>

                <p>Drive stakes down 14” deep on either side of the tree – making sure not to damage the root ball. Attach green stretchy tape approx. 4 ½ feet up the stake, varying slightly depending on tree size. Wrap tape around trunk 360°, and attach to the stake.</p>

                <p>Be sure to allow enough slack for tree to sway slightly in the wind, this will help it to build a strong root system, while protecting it from falling. Check the tightness of the tape periodically as the tree grows, replace it if it becomes too tight. Remove tape and stakes after 1 year.</p>

                        <h2>After Care</h2>

                        <p>During the first summer (or dry season) your tree will need to be watered weekly. To water effectively turn your hose on low, and let water slowly seep into the soil. Less frequent, deep watering is the goal. Let the hose run gently for 30-45 minutes. This will help the tree develop a strong, deep root system.</p>

                        <p>Soaker hoses, tree watering bags and drip systems are also good options for delivering water to a tree at a slow pace, so that it soaks deeply into the soil.</p>

                        <p>In the following years, the tree will need less frequent watering or maybe none at all, depending on the tree’s genetics, light, soil and weather. Taper deep watering off to every other week or once a month.</p>

                        <p>Even old established trees like a deep drink of water before heat waves!</p>
