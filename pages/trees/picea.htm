			<p>Spruce trees are wonderful! They may be a tad prickly on the outside, but Piceas are colorful and reliable. They come in all shapes and sizes too, offering a wide range of garden-worthy options.</p>


					<h2><em>Picea abies:&nbsp;</em>Norway Spruce</h2>

					<p>The magnificent Norway spruce populates much of Europe and is commonly used as a holiday tree. Over 150 cultivated varieties exist, including many with interesting shapes and smaller statures. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

					<h2><em>Picea abies</em> 'Cupressina'</h2>

					<p>'Cupressina' has an upright narrow shape that creates a strong vertical accent, perfect for planting at the corners of a tall house. Needles are dark green and branches are strong, withstanding heavy snow better than other narrow-growing conifers.</p>

					<p>Grows fast, more than 12” per year to 10-12’ x 2’ in 10 years. Sun, Z3.</p>

					<h2><em>Picea abies</em> ‘Pendula’: Weeping Norway Spruce</h2>

					<p>Dark green needles on weeping branches. Often one branch is selected to serve as a trunk and trained to grow upright, allowing the other branches to weep and skirt the ground. Without training branches grow along the ground as a groundcover. Both are nice applications.</p>

					<p>Grows more than 12” per year. Sun, part shade, Z3.</p>

					<h2>Facts: Picea</h2>

					<p><strong>Family:</strong>Pinaceae</p>

					<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Picea – pie-SEE-a
						<br><em>Picea</em> is the Latin word for spruce, derived from the word <em>pix</em>, the word for pitch.</p>

					<p><strong>Common:</strong> Spruce</p>

					<p><strong>Origin:</strong> 40 species, mostly from colder regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>

					<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Evergreen coniferous trees and shrubs are often tall, narrow and symmetrically shaped. Sharp, mostly square needles are held to branches by ‘pegs’ or little pockets that remain on the stem when needles fall.</p>

					<p>Cones are mostly hanging. Many cultivated varieties exist, lending variations in size, color and shape. Dwarf and miniature spruce are good selections to grow in containers. Roots are shallow and spreading, so transplanting is usually successful.</p>

					<p><strong>Light:</strong> Sun to part shade</p>

					<p><strong>Soil:</strong> Moderately moist well-drained soil is preferred, but clay soil is okay. Be mindful to keep trees moist during spring when they’re pushing new growth. During this time they are particularly susceptible to damage and death if they are allowed to be too dry. <em>Picea omorika:</em> Serbian Spruce, and <em>Picea pungens</em>: Colorado Spruce are more tolerant of dry soil conditions like those found in eastern Oregon.</p>

					<p><strong>Pruning &amp; Training:</strong></p>

					<p>Prune from mid-autumn thru winter.</p>

					<p>Be careful not to cut into bare wood, wood without any green attached. Spruce does not generate new growth from bare branches and pruning down too far will cause the branch to die.</p>

					<p>Keep an eye out for reverting growth in cultivated varieties, especially in Alberta spruce. Reversion is the production of shoots that do not match the cultivated plant, for example, upright growth on a weeping plant. Prune reverting growth at its base, as soon as you notice it.</p>

					<p><strong>Alberta Spruce</strong> takes well to shearing and can often be found in nurseries trained and shaped into topiary forms like spirals and pom-poms. To maintain shape, prune yearly during mid-autumn thru winter.</p>

					<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Mites, aphids and bagworms are the most common pests affecting spruce trees. Root rot and rust are common diseases.</p>
