Symmetrical pyramid to narrow tall tree, growing 50-100&rsquo; in cultivation and much larger in the wild. Noble Fir is a popular cut Christmas tree because its strong tiered branching habit is perfect for hanging ornaments. In cultivation, Noble Firs need improved soil drainage, and a moist cool site. They prefer to be in containers for only a short time, no more than one year. Hardy Zone 5.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Abies</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Pinaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Abies &ndash; from the Latin word abire, meaning &lsquo;to rise&rsquo; &ndash; refers to the great height that many firs attain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Fir</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> 50 or so species originating from Europe, northern Africa, Asia and America</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Leaves/needles are usually flat and soft with the exception of Spanish Fir. Female cones stand upright along branches.</p>

                        <p>Habit is pyramidal and symmetrical in the species plants, but can vary to round, pendulous and contorted in cultivated varieties. Firs grow relatively slowly, and even slower in urban environments.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> General requirements are moist, acidic, well-drained soil, high humidity and low temperatures.</p>

                        <p>Culture requirements vary with species - <em>Abies lasiocarpa</em>, our native Sub-alpine Fir, needs very fast draining soil in order to thrive, but <em>Abies grandis</em>, our native Grand Fir adapts easily to a variety of soil types.</p>

                        <p>Planting is best accomplished from mid-autumn to spring so that roots can become established during cooler times of the year.</p>

                        <p>Typically Firs prefer full sun, but light shade is acceptable. Tolerance to cold temperatures varies, but all of the Firs on our list are hardy in Portland.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Insects seem to avoid Firs for the most part, but fungal problems are fairly common, mostly in the form of root-rot. Roots need to be allowed air circulation, so adding compost when planting can help.</p>

                        <p>If the tree requires exceptional drainage, consider blending pumice with the compost, or choosing a tree that will be happy growing in a container.</p>
