			<p>Redbuds are one of spring's eye-catchers when they're covered trunk to tips in flowers. Cute heart-shape leaves in green, purple or gold follow, adorning zig-zagging branches. Most redbuds are small upright trees with round canopies, but a few weeping cultivars exist as well.</p>

					<h2>Facts: Cercis</h2>

					<p><strong>Family:</strong> Fabaceae</p>

					<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Cercis (SEER-sis)</p>

					<p><strong>Common:</strong> Redbud</p>

					<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to East Asia, Southern Europe, United States and Mexico</p>

					<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Members of the pea family, the genus consists of 7 species of shrubs and small trees. Small pea-flowers are white, pink or magenta; occur in clusters or short chains (racemes), usually on old wood in early spring. Leaves are heart-shape and can be green, gold, purple or variegated. Leathery seed pods resemble pea pods and occur in summer.</p>

					<p><strong>Size:</strong> Shrub forms are multi-stemmed and grow 8-10’ x 8-10’. Tree forms range between 10’ at maturity to 25-30’. Weeping forms grow to 6-8’.</p>

					<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Sun or part shade, adapts to many soil types, but cannot survive in a site that is permanently wet. <em>Cercis</em> grows better when planted in a spot that is not in a sprinkler zone during summer. In heavy clay soils, amend with compost &amp; pumice to increase soil drainage. Provide deep watering, every 2 weeks in the first summer (if it gets really hot, say over 95 degrees, give an additional soaking before the heat comes). Cercis is drought tolerant once established.</p>

					<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Susceptible to Verticillium wilt — <a href="https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/redbud-cercis-spp-verticillium-wilt" target="_blank">read more about it here.</a></p>

					<p>With insufficient soil drainage, trees can experience root rot. This is likely the leading cause of death of Cercis in Portland.</p>
