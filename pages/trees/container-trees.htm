	            <h3>Caring for your Container Tree</h3>

				<h3>Container Size</h3>
				<p>To determine container size consider current plant size, eventual plant size, and your space available. The pot should be at least 6” larger in circumference than the current root ball. The plant may need to be up potted or root pruned in future years to maintain a healthy specimen. If the pot is much larger than the current root ball, watering challenges arise.</p>
				<h3>Watering</h3>
				<p>All container plants require more water than the same plant in the ground. In hot summer months the container may need watered every day, depending on the size of the pot. If a small plant is placed in a very large container it can be difficult to keep the actual root ball moist. Take extra care to soak the root zone and not just the excess potting soil.</p>
				<h3>Soil and Fertilizer</h3>
				<p>We recommend potting soil for container plants because it offers the best drainage. Never use dirt dug from the garden. Fertilize once a year, in the spring, with an all-purpose fertilizer of your choice.</p>

				<h3>Planting in the Ground</h3>
				<p>When ready to move your plant from a pot into the ground dig a hole twice as wide and the same depth as the current pot. Fill the hole with water and allow to drain if the soil is dry. Gently loosen the roots if necessary and lower the tree into the hole. Mix in a handful of bone meal or rock phosphate to encourage root development, or add some starter fertilizer if desired.</p>

				<p>Current research recommends not adding compost to the soil. Simply backfill with existing soil around the root ball. Water thoroughly to settle, even on a rainy day.</p>

				<h3>Soil and Fertilizer</h3>

				<p>We recommend potting soil for container plants because it offers the best drainage. Never use top soil or soil dug from the ground. You can mix in up to 20% compost in your containers at planting time, or use it as a top dressing for added nutrients.</p>
				<p>It is important to note soil in containers should ideally be refreshed every 3-6 months, but at least every 1-2 years if using fertilizer.</p>
				<p>Liquid fertilizers are fast acting and convenient, as you apply them when watering. Slow-release fertilizers are simple to apply infrequently. If you have any questions stop by our Information Desk. We’re happy to help!</p>

				<h3>Design Tips	</h3>

				<p>&bull; Choose a few foundation plants, like small to moderate trees and shrubs to give your garden structure and year-round interest. Statuary and pottery also work.</p>
			<p>&bull; Decide the purpose of your garden (curb appeal, improved view, outdoor dining area, etc.) to create a layout. The benefit of having your plants in containers is that you can move them! Keep in mind that containers, once planted and watered, can be quite heavy. Consider getting casters or pot lifters for safety.</p>
			<p>&bull; Draw out a rough sketch of what you want your garden to look like and where things will go. Use Pinterest, design books, magazines, or blogs to find what styles inspire you.</p>
			<p>&bull; Evergreens will keep your garden looking good and alive year-round. Without them, winter will bring empty-looking pots, bare branches, and unattractive, dead material.</p>
