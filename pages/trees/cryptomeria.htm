			<p><em>Cryptomeria</em> is the national tree of Japan. It can be found planted at many sacred sites and is also planted on a large scale as a forest tree. Only one species exists, <em>Cryptomeria japonica</em>.</p>

			<p>It grows fast into a very large lofty, pyramidal or conical evergreen tree, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The wood is scented, waterproof, lightweight and strong, so it is used for all types of construction in Japan.</p>

			<p>Though only one species of <em>Cryptomeria</em> exists, many ornamental varieties are in cultivation and are very suitable to Northwest landscapes. Portland Nursery carries a full selection of miniature to full-size forms to fit perfectly into the any garden site.</p>

			<p><em>Cryptomerias</em> are especially interesting because they offer a wide range of color and texture choices. During winter several varieties have foliage that changes color from green to bronze or burgundy. Some varieties are soft and plume-like foliage while others have branches and leaves that resemble dreadlocks or ringlets. <em>Cryptomerias</em> lend year round interest and are an excellent addition to the Northwest garden.</p>
