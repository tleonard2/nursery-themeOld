                <p>A quick look up of <em>Ginkgo</em> on the internet reveals several websites about the age and ancient nature of <em>Ginkgoes</em>, and several more sites about its use in medicine. Indeed it has been around forever and has many uses, but it seems like such a great ornamental tree that those aspects of the Ginkgo should have a higher profile.</p>

                <p>Gorgeous fan&ndash;shape leaves are hard to beat when in gold fall glory. Add that it can grow almost anywhere (probably one reason it survives since before ancient times) and you&rsquo;ve got a winning plant. (Photo Credit OSU)</p>

                <p>Ginkgoes make great street trees and look wonderful anchoring gardens. They&rsquo;re often used in bonsai and dwarf Ginkgoes are nice choices for container plants.</p>

                <p>Here are some of our favorite varieties.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Ginkgo</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Ginkgoaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Ginkgo (g&ndash;INK&ndash;oe) from the Chinese yin&ndash;kuo meaning silver apricot.</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Maidenhair Tree</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> China</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> One single species, <em>Ginkgo biloba</em>, exists. It has long been in cultivation and many varieties of <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> have been cultivated over time. Pretty green fan&ndash;shape leaves turn bright gold in autumn before falling. Trees drop all of the leaves over a short period of time, making them easy to clean up. Bark is gray with shallow fissures.</p>

                        <p>All <em>Ginkgoes</em> are dioecious, meaning that they are either male or female. Male flowers, or pollen cones, look like clusters of small catkins. Female flowers are twin ovules at the end of a stem & set in clusters. Although ripe fruit is prized food in Japan and China, most gardeners prefer not to grow female Ginkgo trees, as ripening fruit is messy and smells awful.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> 35&rsquo; to 50&rsquo; is common for many <em>Ginkgoes</em>. Many dwarf forms exist as well, growing as slowly as 2&quot;/yr. in a tight ball shape.</p>

                        <p>Ginkgoes are often a bit angular and gawky in youth, but much like humans, fatten out later. Many are tall and slender for 15&ndash;20 years with open spaces between lateral branches, but over time they become rounded and full.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Ginkgoes</em> are not fussy and grow in most circumstances. Give them sun for at least 6 hours a day and reasonably good soil drainage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Most complaints about <em>Ginkgoes</em> are surrounding smelly fruit. This problem is easily avoided by planting male trees.</p>

                        <p>They are typically pest free.</p>
