			<p>A quick look up of <em>Ginkgo</em> on the internet reveals several websites about the age and ancient nature of <em>Ginkgoes</em>, and several more sites about its use in medicine. Indeed it has been around forever and has many uses, but it seems like such a great ornamental tree that those aspects of the Ginkgo should have a higher profile.</p>

			<p>Ginkgoes make great street trees and look wonderful anchoring gardens. They’re often used in bonsai and dwarf Ginkgoes are nice choices for container plants.</p>

			<p>Here are some of our favorite varieties.</p>

					<h2>Facts: Ginkgo</h2>

					<p><strong>Family:</strong> Ginkgoaceae</p>

					<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Ginkgo (g–INK–oe) from the Chinese yin–kuo meaning silver apricot.</p>

					<p><strong>Common:</strong> Maidenhair Tree</p>

					<p><strong>Origin:</strong> China</p>

					<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> One single species, <em>Ginkgo biloba</em>, exists. It has long been in cultivation and many varieties of <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> have been cultivated over time. Pretty green fan–shape leaves turn bright gold in autumn before falling. Trees drop all of the leaves over a short period of time, making them easy to clean up. Bark is gray with shallow fissures.</p>

					<p>All <em>Ginkgoes</em> are dioecious, meaning that they are either male or female. Male flowers, or pollen cones, look like clusters of small catkins. Female flowers are twin ovules at the end of a stem &amp; set in clusters. Although ripe fruit is prized food in Japan and China, most gardeners prefer not to grow female Ginkgo trees, as ripening fruit is messy and smells awful.</p>

					<p><strong>Size:</strong> 35’ to 50’ is common for many <em>Ginkgoes</em>. Many dwarf forms exist as well, growing as slowly as 2"/yr. in a tight ball shape.</p>

					<p>Ginkgoes are often a bit angular and gawky in youth, but much like humans, fatten out later. Many are tall and slender for 15–20 years with open spaces between lateral branches, but over time they become rounded and full.</p>

					<p><strong>Culture:</strong>
						<em>Ginkgoes</em> are not fussy and grow in most circumstances. Give them sun for at least 6 hours a day and reasonably good soil drainage.</p>

					<p><strong>Problems:</strong> Most complaints about <em>Ginkgoes</em> are surrounding smelly fruit. This problem is easily avoided by planting male trees.</p>

					<p>They are typically pest free.</p>
