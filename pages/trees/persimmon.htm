   <p>Persimmon Trees or Diosporos (which translates as &lsquo;food of the gods') are a double delight. They are beautiful in all seasons with a gorgeous, delicious autumn fruit that persists ornamentally after the brightly colored leaves drop.
</p><p>Portland Nursery is proud to offer a brilliant selection of well-established Persimmon trees for fall. Autumn is the most advantageous time for planting these beauties. Trees will be unchallenged by further heat spells, but planted in summer-warmed soil, allowing for healthy root-production. Planted now, trees will be well-established for active growth in spring.</p>  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/persimmon/persimmon2-360.jpg" class="center"  width="360" height="270" alt="Persimmon" />

<p class="clear">The fruit of the persimmon, particularly beautiful in all types is often divided into 2 groups; astringent and non-astringent. This, for practical purposes, lets you know what degree of ripeness is needed before the orange fruit is edible. Similar to pears, Persimmons are picked when firm and then ripened off  the tree.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/persimmon/persimmon360.jpg" class="center"  width="360" height="316" alt="Persimmon" /><p class="clear">Astringent types need to be fully ripened to a very soft-almost overripe tomato degree, before developing sweet, juicy flesh.
</p><p>We offer:
</p><ul>
<li>Chocolate &ndash; Small to medium cylindrical fruit with bright red skin &ndash; sweet, spicy, juicy &amp; firm dark brown flesh &ndash; superb flavor.</li>

<li>Hachiya &ndash; Acorn-shaped, large, with very sweet soft orange flesh.  Excellent quality and leading U.S. commercial variety.</li>

<li>Tamopan &ndash; Acorn-shaped with a large cap-like top, ripens late.</li>

<li>Tanenashi &ndash; Very large, conic fruit is yellow, ripening orange-red.  Delightful flavor, &amp; fine quality - prolific fruit, even when young. Grows to 40' tall.</li>
</ul>

<p> Non-astringent types can be eaten at a much firmer degree of ripeness. We offer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuyu Imoto &ndash; Flat, firm and sweet</li>

<li>Fuyu Jiro &ndash; Medium to large, round, flattened glossy orange-red fruit &ndash; Can be peeled and eaten fresh like an apple, dried, or frozen. Keeps for several months in a cool room.</li>

<li>Giant Fuyu &ndash; 40% larger than other Fuyus. Sweeter, juicier, smooth textured, reddish yellow flesh. Good for fresh eating, dried, frozen or cooked in pastry.</li>

<li>Izu &ndash; Fuyu fruit on a dwarf tree.</li>
</ul>

<p class="clear">Most of the Persimmons at Portland Nursery are self-fruitful, so only one tree need be planted to ensure fruit. Persimmon trees grow to a mature height of about 25-30' tall &amp; wide in Portland. Exceptions are &lsquo;Izu', which is a dwarf tree, maturing at 12-15' tall, and &lsquo;Tanenashi', which matures at 40'. Persimmons are hardy to USDA zone 7-8.</p>

<p class="caption">PERSIMMON</p>


      <h2>Facts: PERSIMMON <h2>Facts: STYRAX </h2>

  <p><strong>Family:</strong>Lythraceae </p>
<p><strong>Genus: </strong>persimmon &ndash; named for Magnus von Lagerstrom (1691-1759), a Swedish merchant and friend of Linnaeus </p>
<p><strong>Common: </strong>Fruit of the Gods or Crepe Myrtle </p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> Native to Japan, China and Korea </p>
<p><strong>Culture: </strong>Fruit of the Godss love sun and heat, and will benefit from improved soil drainage, so adding compost at the time of planting is helpful.  Plants thrive in the hot climates of the Southern U.S. where persimmon is the Texas state shrub.  Most cultivated varieties are hardy to USDA zone 7. </p>
<p><strong>Diseases:</strong>  Powdery Mildew is a common problem for Fruit of the Gods that can be helped by improving soil drainage at the time of planting, increasing air circulation around the plant and avoiding wetting the foliage when watering.  Many sprays are available for treatment as well. </p>
