                <p>Prunus is a huge group of trees and shrubs that includes many of our favorite spring-flowering trees and arguably our tastiest fruits. Peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and almonds are all different species of Prunus.</p>

                <h2><em>Prunus laurocerasus</em>: English Laurel</h2>

                <p>Scented small white flowers along 2&rdquo; spikes in spring develop into seedy black berries in summer.  Leaves are large, pointed, glossy and evergreen.</p>
                <p>The species grows very fast, sometimes more than 4&rsquo; in one year.  In Portland unpruned English Laurels commonly reach 25&rsquo; x 25&rsquo;.  The national champion is 33&rsquo; tall x 52&rsquo; wide in Seattle. </p>
        <p>Often laurels are planted without knowledge of the immense size they can reach in a relatively short amount of time.  They can be kept smaller, to about 8-12&rsquo; tall and wide with pruning twice a year.  If that sounds like a lot of work to you, choose a different plant.  There are several varieties of laurel that grow more slowly.</p>

                <h2>Facts: Prunus</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Prunus (pr-OO-nus)</p>

                <p><strong>Common:</strong> Cherry, Plum, Peach, Almond, Apricot, Nectarine, Laurel</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Over 400 species of trees and shrubs from temperate northern climates world-wide.</p>

                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Flowers are usually white, sometimes pink, usually with 5 petals. Those with more petals are called &lsquo;double&rsquo;. Some flowers, like those on Laurels are held in spikes, or vertical clusters. Many are sweetly fragrant. Fruit is fleshy and single seeded. Leaves are sometimes evergreen but mostly deciduous. Some Prunus that lose their leaves have nice peachy-orange fall color, but most have insignificant fall interest.</p>

                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Shrubs are usually large, growing above 6&rsquo; tall. Trees vary by species. The smallest dwarf Peach trees are mature at just 3&rsquo; tall, and the largest Cherries and Laurels are 40&rsquo; and taller.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Excellent soil drainage is imperative when growing any type of Prunus. Excellent soil drainage means creating a situation where water flows through the soil allowing roots a nice drink. If soil becomes water-logged, roots cannot breathe and will rot. If water runs across the top of the soil without sinking in, like on a slope, roots cannot access enough water.</p>

                <p>Improve soil be blending compost into a wide planting area. Pumice can also be added to sites that are very dense, or to make a bed for particularly testy plants.</p>

                <p><strong>Plums, Cherries and Laurels</strong> are among the more tolerant species of our PNW heavy clay soils. Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots and Almonds are among the more difficult species to grow in our climate. Peaches and Nectarines thrive east of the Cascades where rain is less plentiful, soil is more alkaline and naturally better draining.</p>

                <p>To grow Peaches and other difficult species successfully west of the Cascades, create an environment that is drier during winter months. Growing in containers, under a south-facing eve for example, will allow for enough sun and will limit moisture while providing good soil drainage and a neutral pH.</p>

                <p>For more information on growing fruit trees, follow this link to <a href="../fruits/index.shtml">Portland Nursery&rsquo;s fruit page.</a><br></p>

                <p><strong>Light:</strong> Full sun, at least 6 hours per day, preferably during the warmest part of the day.</p>

                <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Problems are touched-on briefly in the culture section of this page. There are many other concerns though.</p>

                <p>Overgrowth = Over-Work English Laurel grows very fast and will out-grow a spot in no time, requiring pruning several times a year to keep it in check.</p>

                <p>Birds like the fruit If trees are planted to provide fruit, cherries for instance, they may need to be protected from birds, critters like raccoons and insects that appreciate tasty fruit just as much as you do.</p>

                <p><strong>Fungal diseases:</strong> All Prunus are prone to fungal problems. Some, like Shot Hole Fungus, cause just cosmetic damage, where others cause damage to the fruit and leaves, and may ultimately cause the death of the tree.</p>
