                <p>We are among the fortunate, because Magnolias grow in our city. Their big fragrant flowers signal the start of spring, and there are so many different kinds of Magnolias that every month from March to September we can find open Magnolia flowers in Portland. Wow.</p>

                        <h2>Facts: Magnolia</h2>

                        <p><strong>Family:</strong> Magnoliaceae</p>

                        <p><strong>Genus:</strong> Magnolia - Named for Pierre Magnolia (1638-1715) Professor of Botany and Director of Montpellier Botanic Gardens in France</p>

                        <p><strong>Common:</strong> Magnolia</p>

                        <p><strong>Origin:</strong> East Asia, Himalayas, North and Central America</p>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> About 125 species of deciduous or evergreen trees or shrubs. Flowers are large and often scented, coming in white, yellow, pink and purple. Flower buds are covered in gray fuzz. Leaves are alternate or clustered appearing as if whorled around the branch.</p>

                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Size varies per variety and ranges between 6’ tall and 35’ tall.</p>

                        <p><strong>Light:</strong> Afternoon shade is preferred for many species but not all. In Portland, Magnolia grandifloras are best with full sun and plenty of heat.</p>

                        <p><strong>Culture:</strong> Moist well-drained slightly acidic soil is preferred by most. None of the Magnolias are particularly drought tolerant. Even for established plants, a few deep drinks in summer is a good idea. Trees planted in hot afternoon sun need extra water to prevent leaf scorch.</p>

                        <p><strong>Hardiness:</strong> Cold tolerance varies per species between Zones 4 and 8. Portland residents are fortunate to live in a climate mild enough to grow most Magnolias successfully.</p>

                        <p>Late frosts may damage flower buds causing some browning but usually frosts do not prohibit bloom in Portland. Cold winters may damage leaves on evergreen varieties, but bad weather does not typically cause death.</p>

                        <p><strong>Disease:</strong> Magnolias are susceptible to several insects including aphids and scale, but neither represents a large problem in Portland. Powdery mildew can be problematic on some varieties.</p>
