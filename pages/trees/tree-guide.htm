                <p>Why plant trees? Trees provide privacy, prop up hammocks, protect rivers and streams and house wildlife; not to mention the undeniable beauty of their spring flowers and glowing fall colors.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/malus/crabapple-flower750.jpg" alt="crabapple" /><em>Crabapple blossoms</em></figure>

                <p>Trees are versatile as well, with so many sizes and shapes available. Grow a dwarf Japanese maple in a container, shade the house with a majestic Ginkgo, and feature a weeping Crabapple for spring flowers and tiny apples that feed birds in winter.</p>

                <h2 class="brightonM">Right Tree &ndash; Right Place</h2>

                <p>Choosing the right tree is a big deal. In the right place, trees are shade and beauty, but in the wrong place they are headaches, sore backs and empty pocketbooks.</p>

                <h4>Follow a few simple guidelines to help you choose trees<br>
                that accent your life.</h4>

                <h2>The Right Place</h2>

                <p>Take a few important steps before heading to the nursery. Observe your yard and decide on a planting site before shopping.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Utility Lines</strong> &ndash; Call the Oregon Utility Notification Center (503) 246&ndash;6699 before digging to check for underground utility lines.</li>

                    <li><strong>Light</strong> &ndash; Observe light patterns in potential planting areas throughout the day. Pay attention to the direction the site is facing and to existing structures or trees that provide shade.</li>

                    <li><strong>Space</strong> &ndash; trees should be planted 10 &ndash; 15 &rsquo; away from the house and 5 &rsquo; away from patios or fences.</li>

                    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> &ndash; Consider areas where you prefer more privacy and more openness.</li>

                    <li><strong>Existing plantings</strong> &ndash; If the area where a tree is being planted has existing plantings, the new additions to the bed should share the same water needs. Drought tolerant plants go together &ndash; water dependent plants go together.</li>

                    <li><strong>Make Notes &amp; Take Photos!</strong> &ndash; All of this information is important to the nurseryman who may help in making your tree choice, so gather it together and bring it when you shop.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Right Tree</h2>

                <p>There are a number of things to consider when making a tree selection. Answering these questions will help to narrow your choice.</p>

<hr />
                    <h2 class="brightonM">Evergreen or deciduous</h2>

                        <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/magnolia/magnolia750.jpg" alt="m-grandiflora640" /></figure>

                        <p>Evergreen trees keep their leaves or needles during winter. Conifers are evergreen trees with needles or scales for leaves. Broad&ndash;leaf evergreens are trees such as Madrone or <a href="/trees/magnolia/">Southern Magnolia</a> that keep their leaves year round but don&rsquo;t have needles.</p>

                        <p>For help with Conifer Selection, link to our <a href="/trees/conifers/">Conifer Guide</a>.</p>
<hr />
                        <p>Deciduous trees lose leaves in winter. Many have leaves that turn bright (<a href="/trees/stewartia/"><em>Stewartia psuedocamellia</em></a> shown here) colors before they fall off. They are ideal for planting on the south or west side of a house. Light warms the house in winter and the tree shades the house in summer.</p>

                        <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/stewartia/pseudocamellia750.jpg" alt="pseudocamellia" /></figure>

                <hr>

                    <h2 class="brightonM">Size &amp; Shape</h2>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/trees/fall-trees/shape750.jpg" alt="Tree Shape"></figure>

                <p>Trees come in many shapes and sizes. Pyramid, lollipop, column, oval, vase &amp; weeping are the most common shapes.</p>
                <hr>

                    <h2 class="brightonM">Flowers, Fall Color &amp; Winter Interest</h2>

                <p>Flowering trees are wonderful additions to the landscape adding large-scale color during bloom&ndash;time.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/cornus_dogwood/dogwood750.jpg" alt="dogwoodbloom" /></figure>

                <p><a href="/trees/cornus/">Dogwoods (<em>Cornus</em>)</a>, <a href="/trees/cercis/">Redbuds (Cercis)</a>, <a href="/trees/prunus/">Flowering Cherries (<em>Prunus</em>)</a> &amp; <a href="/trees/magnolia/">Magnolias</a> are all lovely choices.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/cercis/fall-cercis750.jpg" alt="fall-cercis" /></figure>

                <p><a href="/trees/acer-fall-color/">Maples (Acer)</a> warm the skies in fall with a range of unbeatable glowing colors, as do <a href="/shrubs-vines/tree-guide/">Crape Myrtles (<em>tree-guide</em>)</a>, <a href="/trees/cercis/">Redbuds (<em>Cercis</em>)</a> and <a href="/trees/ginkgo/">Ginkgoes</a>. <a href="/trees/acer-palmatum/">Coral Bark Maple (<em>Acer palmatum</em> &lsquo;Sango Kaku&rsquo;)</a>.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="http://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/prunus/prserrulata750.jpg" alt="prunus serrulata"></figure>

                <p>Himalayan Birch (<em>Betula jacquemontii</em>) and <a href="/trees/prunus/">Birchbark Cherry (<em>Prunus serrulata</em>)</a> have interesting bark in winter. Many trees hold fruit into winter and provide food for wildlife.</p>
<hr />
                 <h2>Street Trees</h2>

                        <p>Street trees are planted in the area between your sidewalk and the street. <!-- Planting the wrong tree in a parking strip can cause big problems, so the City of Portland provides lists of trees that suit the available space and allow for power lines. --></p>

                        <p>Choosing the right one is a big decision and the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/49305" target="_blank">City of Portland offers lists of suggested trees</a> to help you narrow the possibilities.</p>

                        <p>Street tree lists are set based on the width of the parking strip and whether or not power-lines are present. Portland Nursery carries most trees on the lists but caliper is usually 1 inch to 1 &frac12; inches instead of the 2&quot; that is preferred by the city.</p>

                        <p>Tree availability is seasonal with early spring offering the largest selection.</p>

                        <p>Follow this link to <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/trees/66682" target="_blank">learn about permits and procedures for street tree planting</a> or removal.</p>

                        <p>Portlanders are lucky to live in a city with so much green space. Our combination of rivers, parks and mild climate allows Portland to host a vast array of birds and wildlife, and many will visit or even nest in local yards given a few simple provisions.</p>

                        <p>Create a Bird Haven with attention to the three basics needed for a safe haven for birds: Cover, Food and Water.</p>
