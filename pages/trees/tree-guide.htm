                <p>Choosing the right tree is a big deal. In the right place, trees are shade and beauty, but in the wrong place they are headaches, sore backs and empty pocketbooks.</p>

                <h4>Follow a few simple guidelines to help you choose trees that accent your life.</h4>

                <h3>The Right Place</h3>

                <p>Take a few important steps before heading to the nursery. Observe your yard and decide on a planting site before shopping.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Utility Lines</strong> &ndash; Call the Oregon Utility Notification Center (503) 246&ndash;6699 before digging to check for underground utility lines.</li>

                    <li><strong>Light</strong> &ndash; Observe light patterns in potential planting areas throughout the day. Pay attention to the direction the site is facing and to existing structures or trees that provide shade.</li>

                    <li><strong>Space</strong> &ndash; trees should be planted 10 &ndash; 15 &rsquo; away from the house and 5 &rsquo; away from patios or fences.</li>

                    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> &ndash; Consider areas where you prefer more privacy and more openness.</li>

                    <li><strong>Existing plantings</strong> &ndash; If the area where a tree is being planted has existing plantings, the new additions to the bed should share the same water needs. Drought tolerant plants go together &ndash; water dependent plants go together.</li>

                    <li><strong>Make Notes &amp; Take Photos!</strong> &ndash; All of this information is important to the nurseryman who may help in making your tree choice, so gather it together and bring it when you shop.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Right Tree</h3>

                <p>There are a number of things to consider when making a tree selection. Answering these questions will help to narrow your choice.</p>

<hr />
                    <h2>Evergreen or deciduous</h2>

                        <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ 'assets/images/trees/evergreen.jpg'|theme }}"  alt="tree-guide" title="tree-guide"></figure>

                        <p>Evergreen trees keep their leaves or needles during winter. Conifers are evergreen trees with needles or scales for leaves. Broad&ndash;leaf evergreens are trees such as Madrone or <a href="/trees/magnolia/">Southern Magnolia</a> that keep their leaves year round but don&rsquo;t have needles.</p>

                        <p>For help with Conifer Selection, link to our <a href="/trees/conifers/">Conifer Guide</a>.</p>
<hr />
                        <p>Deciduous trees lose leaves in winter. Many have leaves that turn bright (<a href="/trees/stewartia/"><em>Stewartia psuedocamellia</em></a> shown here) colors before they fall off. They are ideal for planting on the south or west side of a house. Light warms the house in winter and the tree shades the house in summer.</p>

                <hr>

                    <h2 class="brightonM">Size &amp; Shape</h2>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/trees/fall-trees/shape750.jpg" alt="Tree Shape"></figure>

                <p>Trees come in many shapes and sizes. Pyramid, lollipop, column, oval, vase &amp; weeping are the most common shapes.</p>
                <hr>

                    <h2 class="brightonM">Flowers, Fall Color &amp; Winter Interest</h2>

                <p>Flowering trees are wonderful additions to the landscape adding large-scale color during bloom&ndash;time.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/cornus_dogwood/dogwood750.jpg" alt="dogwoodbloom" /></figure>

                <p><a href="/trees/cornus/">Dogwoods (<em>Cornus</em>)</a>, <a href="/trees/cercis/">Redbuds (Cercis)</a>, <a href="/trees/prunus/">Flowering Cherries (<em>Prunus</em>)</a> &amp; <a href="/trees/magnolia/">Magnolias</a> are all lovely choices.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/cercis/fall-cercis750.jpg" alt="fall-cercis" /></figure>

                <p><a href="/trees/acer-fall-color/">Maples (Acer)</a> warm the skies in fall with a range of unbeatable glowing colors, as do <a href="/shrubs-vines/tree-guide/">Crape Myrtles (<em>tree-guide</em>)</a>, <a href="/trees/cercis/">Redbuds (<em>Cercis</em>)</a> and <a href="/trees/ginkgo/">Ginkgoes</a>. <a href="/trees/acer-palmatum/">Coral Bark Maple (<em>Acer palmatum</em> &lsquo;Sango Kaku&rsquo;)</a>.</p>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/prunus/prserrulata750.jpg" alt="prunus serrulata"></figure>

                <p>Himalayan Birch (<em>Betula jacquemontii</em>) and <a href="/trees/prunus/">Birchbark Cherry (<em>Prunus serrulata</em>)</a> have interesting bark in winter. Many trees hold fruit into winter and provide food for wildlife.</p>

	                     <h2>Street Trees</h2>

                        <p>Street trees are planted in the area between your sidewalk and the street. <!-- Planting the wrong tree in a parking strip can cause big problems, so the City of Portland provides lists of trees that suit the available space and allow for power lines. --></p>

                        <p>Choosing the right one is a big decision and the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/trees/66682" target="_blank">City of Portland offers lists of suggested trees</a> to help you narrow the possibilities.</p>

                        <p>Street trees are selected to fit differing sizes of parking strips, taking into consideration the existence of power lines. Portland Nursery carries most of the trees suggested by the City of Portland, but usually the caliper sizes are smaller; our trees are mostly 1”-1 &frac12;” in caliper.
                        </p>

                        <p>Tree availability is seasonal with early spring offering the largest selection.</p>

                        <p>Follow this link to <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/trees/65394" target="_blank">learn about permits and procedures for street tree planting</a> or removal.</p>

	                    <h2>Treebate</h2>

                        <p>Did you know that the City of Portland will reimburse you for part of the cost when you plant a tree in your yard? <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/51399" target="_blank">Treebate</a> is a seasonal program available between <strong>September 1 and April 30 of the following year</strong>&nbsp;to coincide with the best time of the year to plant.  Just follow the few <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/314187" target="_blank">simple guidelines found here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Every tree planted in Portland contributes to clean rivers and healthy watersheds. Plant an eligible tree on a residential property and Environmental Services will credit your city water/sewer utility bill for half the purchase price.</p>

                        <h2 class="center">How to Get Your Treebate</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Purchase a tree between October 1 and April 30 of the following year.</li>

                            <li>Plant it in your Portland residential yard. Complete and submit a Treebate form by April 30 - include the tree purchase receipt with the purchase price circled.</li>
