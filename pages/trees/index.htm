                   <p> “There is always music amongst the trees in the Garden, but our hearts must be very quiet to hear it.” - Minnie Aumonier</p>
                <p>Why plant trees? Trees provide privacy, prop up hammocks, protect rivers and streams and house wildlife; not to mention the undeniable beauty of their spring flowers and glowing fall colors.</p>

                <p>Trees are versatile as well, with so many sizes and shapes available. Grow a dwarf Japanese maple in a container, shade the house with a majestic Ginkgo, and feature a weeping Crabapple for spring flowers and tiny apples that feed birds in winter.</p>
