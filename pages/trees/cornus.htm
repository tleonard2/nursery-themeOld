			<p>One of the most anticipated signs of spring in Portland is our flowering trees. In April, flowering Cherry and Plum trees conclude their reign, making way for our magnificent Dogwoods. In Portland, white and pink flowers dot the city, insisting that spring rain gives up and makes room for sunshine.</p>

Several cultivars are available that have variegated leaves, adding a decorative aspect to the tree during summer months when flowering is over. Grows slowly to 15-20’ tall with a traditional round shape. Grows best with morning sun and afternoon shade – check cultural requirements.</p>

					<p><em>Cornus florida:</em> is susceptible to anthracnose and other diseases that effect Dogwoods. Please check disease information available on this page. Hardy Z6</p>

					<p>Our native Dogwood tree that blooms with brilliant white flowers in April-May, and often surprises with a second bloom in autumn!

					<h2>Facts: Cornus</h2>

					<p><strong>Family:</strong>Cornaceae</p>

					<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Cornus</p>

					<p><strong>Common:</strong> Dogwood</p>

					<p><strong>Origin:</strong> 45-50 species native to Asia, Europe and North America. Several species are native to the Pacific Northwest.</p>

					<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The genus is made up of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Flowers are borne in clusters that are sometimes surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Often the bracts are confused with flowers as they are brightly colored and showy in spring.</p>

					<p><strong>Leaves</strong> are opposite except for <em>Cornus alternifolia</em> and <em>Cornus controversa</em>. Variegated leaf-forms exist but most species have medium green leaves that turn red &amp; purple in autumn.</p>

					<p><strong>Fruit</strong> is 2 seeded and ranges in color from white to pink to red.</p>

					<p><strong>Size:</strong> Tree-form Dogwoods range in size from 15’ to 35’ tall</p>

					<p>Shrub-form Dogwoods range from 12” to 15’ tall</p>

					<p>Herbaceous Dogwoods – 3-6” tall forming a mat</p>

					<p><strong>Culture:</strong> Cultural needs vary widely.</p>

					<p><strong>Success with Dogwood trees</strong> - Many Dogwood trees grow as under story trees in their native habitats, thriving with filtered sunlight and soil that has built perfect structure after years of leaves and needles dropping and composting on the forest floor. It is rare to find such conditions within city limits.</p>

					<p><strong>For best results:</strong></p>

					<p><strong>1. Site</strong> the tree in a spot that gets sunshine in the morning &amp; shade in the afternoon. Too much shade will inhibit flowering and fall color, too much sun can burn leaves. If you ignore this and choose a spot with full sun, realize that the tree will require more water in summer and may have scorched leaves.</p>

					<p><strong>2. Mix compost</strong> and EB Stone Sure Start Fertilizer into the soil when planting.</p>

					<p><strong>3. Add water</strong> even if it’s raining.</p>

					<p><strong>4. Add a layer</strong> of mulch over the surface of the roots, taking care to leave the trunk clear.</p>

					<p><strong>5, During the first year</strong> the tree will require regular irrigation. Water deeply for 20-30 minutes, enough to soak the root system. Water infrequently, maybe twice a week when temperatures are in the 80-90 degree range. More if temperatures are hotter, less if it is colder. Soaker hoses and Tree Gators work well to provide slow-release deep watering. When tree roots are established, they require less irrigation.</p>

					<p><strong>6. Lawn watering</strong> that is daily and shallow is not appropriate for establishing healthy root systems in trees.</p>

					<p><strong>Diseases:</strong> Dogwoods are prone to several fungal diseases. <a href="https://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/system/files/onn020307.pdf" target="_blank">The Oregon State University website</a> has great disease photos and information for treatment.</p>
