                <p><em>Leptinella</em> is a creeping perennial groundcover that spreads quickly by rhizomatous runners just under the soil surface.</p>

                <p>Leaves are feathery or fern-like with colors ranging from grayish-green to bright green with gray, purple and black tints. Flowers are tiny button-like heads without the petal-like ray florets usually associated with daisies. Colors of flowers range from white to yellow or even black.</p>

                <p><em>Leptinella</em> stays evergreen during the majority of Portland’s winters and grows well in shade or sun. Once established, <em>Leptinella</em> forms dense mats that can withstand regular foot traffic. This ground cover looks great in many different types of gardens, such as fairy, Japanese, and woodland. In terms of function, <em>Leptinella</em> is useful as a durable lawn substitute, living patio, or planting between pavers<br>
                or along the edges of pathways.</p>
