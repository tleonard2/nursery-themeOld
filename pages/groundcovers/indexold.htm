                <p>The term &quot;ground cover&quot; includes low-growing plants that never reach more than a couple of inches in height as well as others that might grow as tall as two feet or more. Most of these plants spread easily, which is why they're called &quot;ground covers.&quot;</p>

                <p>Just about any spreading perennial can be used as a ground cover, and even clump-formers can be planted en-masse to create the same effect. Begin your search for ground covers by observing what grows well now in your yard. If you have areas with many happy astilbes or hostas, why not plant more to create a ground cover?</p>

<p>There are many reasons that ground covers are planted. They are perfect for pathways and can be a great alternative for a lawn. Ground covers also help with weed control, and erosion control on steep hillside locations. Every plant is different, so be sure to know what you want. Do you want to walk on it? Should it be evergreen or flowering? What do you want from a prospective ground cover?</p>

<p>We hope this article helps you find the ideal plant that will provide you with the outcome and look you desire. This list is by no means complete, so feel free to ask an employee for more help and information about any questions you may have. Please note that all plants are subject to seasonal availability.</p>

<p>Plants are organized into categories for easier selection. Those that are in light font are suitable for partly shady areas and the plants in bold font can take full shade. All the others are best for sunny locations.</p>

                <p>It is important to choose the right ground cover to fit your needs and the site requirements. Our ground cover sections are organized according to requirements such as evergreen, paths and drought tolerant to make your selection process easier.</p>

                <p>The only maintenance required is to snip off the runners or simply walk on the plants. Many gardeners have relied on ground covers to serve some of the same functions as mulch</p>
