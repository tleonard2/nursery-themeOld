                <p><em>Erodiums</em> can add a beautiful detail to a site in need of a small scale groundcover. As members of the geranium family, their flowers have a familiar delicacy and beauty. The names <em>Erodium</em> and <em>Geranium</em> come from the Ancient Greek words for “crane” and “heron”, after the shape of the flower and immature fruits, which are shaped like the head and beak of a bird.</p>

                <p>These plants are as versatile as they are pretty! They are a great choice for containers, fairy gardens, rock gardens, and alpine plantings, and are a great plant to introduce color into dry, part-shade areas. Try them with <em>Lewisias</em>, or in a container with a dwarf conifer. Imagine them as a cheerful pink bumper alongside your stone path or patio. And best of all, most varieties of <em>Erodium</em> bloom for nearly half the year!</p>

                <p>Most commonly available <em>Erodiums</em> are of the species reichardii, and have leaves varying in shape from round to heart-shaped, approximately ½” long and wide, with gently toothed margins. The flowers are small (½” across) and often veined, with white or pink petals. They take a season or so to double in size, and have a clumping growth habit.</p>

                <p>A few types of <em>Erodium</em> sometimes found at Portland Nursery include:</p>

                <h2>Facts: Erodium</h2>

                <p><strong>Family:</strong> Geraniaceae (Geranium Family)</p>

                <p><strong>Genus:</strong> <em>Erodium</em></p>

                <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Alpine Geranium, Cranesbill, Heronsbill, Storksbill</p>

                <p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Mediterranean region has the most diversity of <em>Erodiums</em>, but members of this genus can be found in similar climates around the world.</p>

                <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <em>Erodiums</em> can succeed in nearly any spot in the yard, as long as they’re not in boggy soil or deep shade. They like sun and fast-draining soils, and should be planted 8-10” apart.</p>

                <p>Established plants can be divided in the spring. In late spring, side shoots can be dug from the side of a mature crown. Be sure to include a small attached chunk of the parent crown with the side shoot.</p>

                <p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> <em>Erodiums</em> require very little in the way of maintenance. When they’re newly planted, they’ll appreciate warm-weather watering. Once established, they’ll take care of themselves, leaving you plenty of time to enjoy their beauty!</p>

                <p><strong>Pest and Disease:</strong> There are no pests or diseases common to <em>Erodiums</em>.</p>
