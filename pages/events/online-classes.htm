<h3>Think Like Fire -- Firescaping Urban Lands</h3>

<p>In the last few years it seems summers are getting hotter and fire “season” stretches out for longer. Living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire as Santa Rosa, California and Talent, Oregon residents learned too well and so painfully. Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge it would be wise to consider strategies for Firescaping your landscape.</p>
<p>Join Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a> for a discussion of various strategies of designing landscapes to resist fires which will include plants that are not easily combustible (and examples of popular plants that are combustible) and management strategies which homeowners can implement.<br>
<strong>Saturday &bull; February 27 &bull; 1:00pm</strong><br>
