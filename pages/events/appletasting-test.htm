               <p> We’ve all had to learn to do things a little differently in 2020, and it’s with heavy hearts that we will be unable to host our traditional Apple Tasting festival onsite this fall. </p>

	               <p>We will, however, continue to support both our growers and community through apple sales and donations, and we’re planning to host several virtual events to bring you a taste of the festival we’ve happily hosted since 1987.</p>

			   <p>Apples will be available at both our Stark and Division locations for $.99/lb throughout the months of September and October, and we’ll be updating the varieties on hand right here along with some excellent tasting notes and advice from Ken—our resident Apple Expert!</p>


<h3>Apples Available only at Stark (phone Division for availability):</h3>

<h4>ELSTAR</h4>
<p>Developed for European markets, this apple’s flavor varies from tart to sweet to balanced, depending on when it’s picked. Excellent for sauce or pies.</p>

<hr>
<!--

<h4>GINGER GOLDEN</h4>
<p>Chance seedling from an orchard in West Virginia, this creamy yellow, sweet-tart apple is great for early fresh eating.</p>

<hr>


<h4>MCINTOSH</h4>
<p>Origin 1800's, Canada. Sweet, tender, soft & juicy, especially good for dessert and cider.</p>

<hr>
-->
<h4>GALA</h4>
<p>Yellow flesh is crisp and aromatic. Good for fresh eating.</p>

<hr>

<h4>SWISS GOURMET (Arlet Cultivar)</h4>
<p>Patented and owned by Portland Nursery. Golden Delicious x Ida Red, origin Switzerland, 1958. Its firm, juicy flesh makes it one of the best both for fresh eating and for pies.</p>
