<h2 class="wkend">Open Wreath Making Classes & Private Group Wreath Making Workshops</h2>

<!--
<p>Start a new tradition by gathering with friends and family to hand-make fresh green wreaths for your home or to give as a gift. Join us in our socially distanced class space—a covered, heated outdoor greenhouse—where our enthusiastic teachers will guide you through the process of making a wreath that is unique to you and guaranteed to bring cheer into your home. Bring your pruners, gloves, a mask, and of course, your holiday spirit! For information on registering for an Open Class or scheduling a Private Wreath Making Workshop, including material fees, please read below.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>Open Classes and Private Group Workshops will be held at 9000 SE Division.</p>

<p><strong>Masks will be required to participate.</strong></p>


<h3>Material Fees</h3>

<p><strong>Basic Wreath: $40 per person.</strong><br/>
Includes fresh cut greens, pine cones, and a bow.</p>

<p><strong>Deluxe Wreath: $48 per person.</strong><br/>
Includes everything from the Basic Wreath, plus cut floral add-ins.</p>

<p><em><strong>All material fees will be paid in person at the time of the class, for both Open Classes and Private Group Workshops.</strong></em></p>
-->

<p>We are sad to say that all in-person wreath making classes, both open and private, have been cancelled in accordance with new state COVID-19 guidelines. We are so sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. We’re looking into holding virtual wreath making classes, and this page will be updated with that information as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for those of you who’d love to make a wreath at home, we do have plenty of cut greens, wire, wreath rings, ribbons, and other sparkly wreath making supplies available at BOTH locations, and will continue to do so throughout the season.</p>

<p>As always, please be healthy, be safe, and grow your passions!</p>
