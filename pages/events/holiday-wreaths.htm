<h2 class="wkend">Holiday Wreaths</h2>

<p>Portland Nursery has everything you need to make your home a festive one this holiday season—from living trees and ornaments to adorn them, to fresh, pre-made wreaths. For those of you who would like to craft your own, we offer an assortment of cut greens and floral, and to make it even easier, we’re also offering prepackaged wreath making kits that include 5 pounds of cut greens, a wreath ring, and paddle wire for $22.99.</p>

<p>If you’ve never made a wreath before, there’s no need to worry! Check out the videos below for step-by-step instructions, and if you have any questions along the way, just give us a call.</p>


<p>If you would prefer not to shop for a wreath kit in person, you can use the Portland Nursery website to arrange for <a target="_blank" href="http://portlandnursery.com/resources/plant-order-division">curbside pickup</a> at the Division location.</p>
