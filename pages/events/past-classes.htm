<p>with Elaine Kelley of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MilkweedMustardSeed/">Milkweed &amp; Mustard Seed</a><br />

<p>with Portland Nursery’s own Jess Fancon<br />
Yes, you can successfully overwinter your tropical and borderline hardy plants by storing them in a protected place or by treating them as houseplants. Jess will teach you how to keep your Abutilon, Alocasia, Colocasia, Red Banana, Caladium, Begonias, Brugmansia, and Cannas safe and happy all winter long. She will demonstrate how to prune and store the red banana (Ensete maurelii) and how to pull and store canna rhizomes.

                    <p>with Gradey Proctor, <a target="_blank" href="http://arctosschool.org">Arctos School of Herbal Studies</a><br>
                    Join Gradey Proctor from the Arctos School of Herbal and Botanical Studies for an exploration of the underground world of the plant, the root! As we move towards winter, perennial plants send their energy into the earth creating the opportunity for us to dig and divide plants, as well as harvest medicine. We will explore a half dozen medicinal plants by going through their medicinal uses, different ways of making root medicine, the botany of underground structures and most importantly, how to do all this while keeping our plants thriving.</p>
