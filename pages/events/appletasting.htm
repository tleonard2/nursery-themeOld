               <p> We’ve all had to learn to do things a little differently in 2020, and it’s with heavy hearts that we will be unable to host our traditional Apple Tasting festival onsite this fall. </p>

	               <p>We will, however, continue to support both our growers and community through apple sales and donations, and we’re planning to host several virtual events to bring you a taste of the festival we’ve happily hosted since 1987.</p>

			   <p>Apples will be available at both our Stark and Division locations for $.79/lb through the months of November, and we’ll be updating the varieties on hand right here along with some excellent tasting notes and advice from Ken—our resident Apple Expert!</p>


<h3>Apples Available:</h3>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> the apples listed below represent what was most recently delivered, and that the varieties on hand may change throughout the week. If you see something you’re really excited about, please give us a call before coming in to ensure we have what you’re looking for!</p>
