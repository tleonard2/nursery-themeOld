<h3>Firescaping</h3>
    <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br />
In the last few years it seems summers are getting hotter and fire “season” stretches out for longer.  And living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire. Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge it might be wise to consider strategies for Firescaping your landscape.  Bonnie Bruce will discuss designing landscapes to resist fires, including plants that are not easily combustible, plants that are combustible, and management strategies which homeowners can implement.</p>

	<h3>Captured Sunlight: Dyeing with Marigolds</h3>
<p>with Iris Sullivan Daire<br>
Marigolds, the familiar flower beloved by gardeners, are used to adorn altars in many cultures. They also happen to make a delightful dye plant, with capacity to dye silk nearly the same happy color as the flowers themselves! In this fun, hands-on class, students will learn the basics of dyeing with flowers, and come away with a long silk scarf they dye themselves. As we enter the season of darkness, silk can be used to adorn your home or yourself with the colors of the sun. Students will receive a packet of seeds for "Shades of Gold" Marigold so they can look forward to making flower garlands and using their new knowledge for more dyeing sessions next summer. Materials fee: $30 payable to instructor.</p>
