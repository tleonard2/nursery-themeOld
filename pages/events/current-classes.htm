<h3>Firescaping</h3>
    <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br />
In the last few years it seems summers are getting hotter and fire “season” stretches out for longer.  And living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire. Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge it might be wise to consider strategies for Firescaping your landscape.  Bonnie Bruce will discuss designing landscapes to resist fires, including plants that are not easily combustible, plants that are combustible, and management strategies which homeowners can implement.</p>
