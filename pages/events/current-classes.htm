<h3>Top 10 Orchid Myths</h3>
<p>with Sue Volek of the Oregon Orchid Society<br />
There's lots of tips out there about growing orchids. Some are true and some are false.  This talk will debunk some of the misperceptions about these beautiful plants and give you the bottom line on how to select, grow, and bloom the easiest orchid plants. Sue Volek has been growing orchids for almost 20 years. A journalist and communications person during the day, she would come home and tend her plants at night until they took over not only the kitchen, but the living room, dining room, and encroached on the rest of the house. Her current favorites are slipper orchids, but since she never met an orchid she didn't like, Sue has an array of plants from asocendas to zygopetalums. She is president of the Oregon Orchid Society.</p>
