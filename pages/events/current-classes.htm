<h3>Firescaping</h3>
    <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br />
In the last few years it seems summers are getting hotter and fire “season” stretches out for longer.  And living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire. Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge it might be wise to consider strategies for Firescaping your landscape.  Bonnie Bruce will discuss designing landscapes to resist fires, including plants that are not easily combustible, plants that are combustible, and management strategies which homeowners can implement.</p>

	<h3>Writing and Drawing with Plants</h3>
<p>with interdisciplinary artist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tamaralynne.net">Tamara Lynne</a>, of Portland Nursery<br>
Bring a hardback notebook with blank pages and a pen/pencil or any other drawing materials, and settle in to enjoy quiet writing and drawing inspiration from the many vibrant living things around us: plants, trees, insects, birds, sun, wind and weather. We’ll engage with the environment through close listening, careful observation, and a series of timed prompts. We hope to be outside for part of the time, weather permitting. Chairs will be provided, but feel free to bring cushions or fold-up chairs if you like.</p>
