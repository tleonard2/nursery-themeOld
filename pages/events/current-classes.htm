<h3>Gift Orchid Survival Workshop</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>with Janis McBride, Master Gardener<br>
Orchids in bloom make such beautiful gifts, but most of them fail to survive for long. At this workshop, Master Gardener Janis McBride will demonstrate step-by-step methods to help you easily turn those gifts into healthy, colorful, long-blooming orchids for your home. This hands-on class will give you an understanding of the natural growth pattern of the orchid, and how this influences orchid re-potting techniques. If you have one, you can bring your own gift orchid to be repotted. Pest management and nutrition will be covered briefly.</p>

Bring a hardback notebook with blank pages and a pen/pencil or any other drawing materials, and settle in to enjoy quiet writing and drawing inspiration from the many vibrant living things around us: plants, trees, insects, birds, sun, wind and weather. Through close listening, careful observation, and a series of timed prompts, we’ll engage with the environment. We hope to be outside for part of the time, weather permitting. Chairs will be provided, but feel free to bring cushions or other seating if you like.</p>
