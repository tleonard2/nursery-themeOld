<p>with Iris Sullivan Daire, <a target="_blank" href="http://dreambirdstudio.com/">Dream Bird Studio</a><br />
	Ecoprinting is an easy way to directly transfer the colors of plants to paper and cloth. Many common trees, weeds, and garden plants are especially good for this. In this class, we will show examples of ecoprinting from plants gathered at the nursery. Participants will come away with new ideas for preserving the beauty of their garden, and a list of plants to include in their landscape for this purpose. At completion of class, color prints will steam for one hour. Participants are invited to wander around and return at 1:00 pm to see the results. Materials fee: $8 payable to instructor.</p>
