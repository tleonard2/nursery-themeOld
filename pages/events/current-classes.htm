Participants will be able to observe Bonsai trees from his and the trainees’ personal collections, ranging in size from very large to palm-size, and ranging in age from a few years to decades.  The processes necessary to maintain the health and development of these pieces of living art over decades will be explained.  Bonsai is a year-round gardening pursuit, providing engagement in multiple horticultural practices in every season.

<p>with Marc Scheidecker<br>
As Steve Solomon says in his gardening primer, Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades, “Generally speaking, a healthy plant will either be un-attackable or will outgrow insect damage nor succumb to diseases.” In Marc’s class he will examine how to grow “healthy plants” in detail, drawing on research-based information from Steve Solomon, Nancy Bubel, Michael Astera, Elaine Ingham, and others. Not only will he provide a class handout that covers 60 different ways to achieve this goal, but he will go over several of these most important methods with the group.</p>

<div class="dclass"><h3>Growing Nutrition Packed Vegetables</h3>
<p>with Marc Scheidecker<br>
Is there really a difference between the average vegetable plant and one grown for maximum levels of nutrition? A study done by Rutgers University researchers reported mineral variations as great as 1,938 parts per million of iron in some tomatoes as opposed to only one ppm in other tomatoes of the same variety! There is a lot we can do to raise the level of nutrients in our vegetables. Healthy plants can only come from healthy soil. Come learn how to grow more nutritious vegetables by improving your soil.</p>

Bring a hardback notebook with blank pages and a pen/pencil or any other drawing materials, and settle in to enjoy quiet writing and drawing inspiration from the many vibrant living things around us: plants, trees, insects, birds, sun, wind and weather. Through close listening, careful observation, and a series of timed prompts, we’ll engage with the environment. We hope to be outside for part of the time, weather permitting. Chairs will be provided, but feel free to bring cushions or other seating if you like.</p>
