<h3>Guilt-free Lawns</h3>

<p>with Claudia Groth of Portland Nursery<br>
Lawns pump oxygen into the environment around our homes, they cool the air in summer’s heat, they relax us as they absorb urban noise, and they cushion a child’s play. Whether your lawn is toddler-sized or golf course-sized, make it the best it can be. Claudia will guide Portland’s lawn lovers through a year in the life of a well-maintained lawn. </p>

<p>with Iris Sullivan Daire, <a target="_blank" href="http://dreambirdstudio.com/">Dream Bird Studio</a><br />
	Ecoprinting is an easy way to directly transfer the colors of plants to paper and cloth. Many common trees, weeds, and garden plants are especially good for this. In this class, we will show examples of ecoprinting from plants gathered at the nursery. Participants will come away with new ideas for preserving the beauty of their garden, and a list of plants to include in their landscape for this purpose. At completion of class, color prints will steam for one hour. Participants are invited to wander around and return at 1:00 pm to see the results. Materials fee: $8 payable to instructor.</p>

<h3>Firescaping (designing landscapes to resist fires)</h3>
    <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br />
In the last few years it seems summers are getting hotter and fire “season” stretches out for longer.  And living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire as Santa Rosa residents learned too well and so painfully.  Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge, it might be wise to consider strategies for firescaping your landscape.</p>
<p>Come join Bonnie Bruce who will discuss various strategies of designing landscapes to resist fires which will include plants that are not easily combustible (and examples of popular plants that are combustible) and management strategies which homeowners can implement.</p>
