	<h3>Writing and Drawing with Plants</h3>
<p>with interdisciplinary artist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tamaralynne.net">Tamara Lynne</a>, of Portland Nursery<br>
Bring a hardback notebook with blank pages and a pen/pencil or any other drawing materials, and settle in to enjoy quiet writing and drawing inspiration from the many vibrant living things around us: plants, trees, insects, birds, sun, wind and weather. We’ll engage with the environment through close listening, careful observation, and a series of timed prompts. We hope to be outside for part of the time, weather permitting. Chairs will be provided, but feel free to bring cushions or fold-up chairs if you like.</p>
