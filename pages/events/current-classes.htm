	<h3>Captured Sunlight: Dyeing with Marigolds</h3>
<p>with Iris Sullivan Daire<br>
Marigolds, the familiar flower beloved by gardeners, are used to adorn altars in many cultures. They also happen to make a delightful dye plant, with capacity to dye silk nearly the same happy color as the flowers themselves! In this fun, hands-on class, students will learn the basics of dyeing with flowers, and come away with a long silk scarf they dye themselves. As we enter the season of darkness, silk can be used to adorn your home or yourself with the colors of the sun. Students will receive a packet of seeds for "Shades of Gold" Marigold so they can look forward to making flower garlands and using their new knowledge for more dyeing sessions next summer. Materials fee: $30 payable to instructor.</p>
