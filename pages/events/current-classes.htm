	                    <p>with Marc Scheidecker<br />
What are the benefits? Well, if you were a bird you'd get the worm, for one! Other benefits that come from starting early are that some plants really like cold weather, and starting early translates to harvesting earlier and therefore freeing up your space for your next crop. A win-win season to season. This class will focus on propagation instruction and include a hands-on activity allowing you to carry away two pots with seed already planted! $5 materials fee, payable at the register before class.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Orchid Myths</h3>
<p>with Sue Volek of the Oregon Orchid Society<br />
There's lots of tips out there about growing orchids. Some are true and some are false.  This talk will debunk some of the misperceptions about these beautiful plants and give you the bottom line on how to select, grow, and bloom the easiest orchid plants. Sue Volek has been growing orchids for almost 20 years. A journalist and communications person during the day, she would come home and tend her plants at night until they took over not only the kitchen, but the living room, dining room, and encroached on the rest of the house. Her current favorites are slipper orchids, but since she never met an orchid she didn't like, Sue has an array of plants from asocendas to zygopetalums. She is president of the Oregon Orchid Society.</p>
