                    <p>with Marc Scheidecker<br>
                    Want to grow vegetables that taste absolutely incredible and, more importantly, are dense with nutrients? To grow this kind of food requires that our soil be rich in microorganisms. How many should be in really good soil? Well, Oregon State University Extension Service says about one billion give or take, in each level teaspoon! And, while they work for free, they do need food. This is where the rock phosphate, kelp meal, cottonseed meal and other soil enhancements come in. Come on in, let's talk about it!</p>
