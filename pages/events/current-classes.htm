                <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br>
                Winter is a perfect time to plan for changes and improvements to your garden but few people think of this until spring really blooms. But by that time contractors are already busy and you are left in the queue waiting. However if you plan now and get a jump on the season you will not only be one of the first on the installation schedule but it is very likely you will get a lower bid because contractors are hungry for work NOW.</p>

                    <h3>Growing Fava Beans- Eat your cover crop!</h3>

                    <p>with Marc Scheidecker<br>
                    Legumes might well be a gardener’s best friend! September is a great month to plant some fava beans! These legumes “fix” nitrogen for our soil- for free!. In addition, the entire plant, which can grow to six feet, can be composted or turned under to add organic matter to the soil.</p>

                    <p>And some of today's varieties are DELICIOUS! We will discuss these topics as well as how to protect them from voracious black aphids.</p>

                <h3>Sheet Mulching</h3>

                <p>with Corina Reynolds of Portland Nursery<br>
                Whether you’re putting your garden beds to sleep for the season, preparing a new bed for planting in the spring, or just want to eliminate some lawn, sheet mulching (AKA lasagna gardening) is a great way to turn inexpensive materials into fabulous growing space. Corina will explain sheet mulching techniques and offer a demonstration for this no-dig method.</p>
