<h3>Firescaping</h3>
    <p>with Bonnie Bruce of <a href="https://celilogardens.com" target="_blank">Celilo Gardens</a><br />
In the last few years, it seems summers get hotter and “fire season” stretches out longer.  And living in an urban environment is not always protection against a wildfire as Santa Rosa residents learned too well and so painfully.  Whether you have a vacation home secluded in a quiet spot in the forest or live at the edge of an urban wildlife refuge it might be wise to consider strategies for Firescaping your landscape. Come join Bonnie Bruce who will discuss various strategies of designing landscapes to resist fires which will include plants that are not easily combustible (and examples of popular plants that are combustible) and management strategies which homeowners can implement.</p>

<h3>Working with Water</h3>
    <p>with Jacquie Boger of Art and Soil Sustainable Garden Solutions<br>
Part of planning a garden is dealing with water: the wet spots, the dry spots, and -- especially in our winters -- where to put all the rain. So why not work that into your plan from the beginning? Learn about what it takes to integrate stormwater infiltration into your landscape with dry creek beds and drywells, swales, and other techniques. Envision your irrigation zones so you don't end up with thirsty plants struggling in hard-to-reach places.</p>
