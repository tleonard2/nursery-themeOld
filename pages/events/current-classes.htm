<h3>Top 10 Orchid Myths</h3>
<p>with Sue Volek of the <a target="_blank" href="http://oregonorchidsociety.org/">Oregon Orchid Society</a><br />
There's lots of tips out there about growing orchids. Some are true and some are false.  This talk will debunk some of the misperceptions about these beautiful plants and give you the bottom line on how to select, grow, and bloom the easiest orchid plants. Sue Volek has been growing orchids for almost 20 years. A journalist and communications person during the day, she would come home and tend her plants at night until they took over not only the kitchen, but the living room, dining room, and encroached on the rest of the house. Her current favorites are slipper orchids, but since she never met an orchid she didn't like, Sue has an array of plants from asocendas to zygopetalums. She is president of the Oregon Orchid Society.</p>

                    <h3>Creating a Pollinator Friendly Landscape</h3>

<p>with Maya Goklany of the Walama Restoration Project<br/>
This workshop will focus on how to create pollinator habitat, with an emphasis on plants native to the Willamette Valley and Western Cascades. Growing native plants is easy! Since they are adapted to the Northwest’s climate and pests, you can create a landscape that requires little or no irrigation and you won’t have to deal with losing plants to pesky aphids, leaf miners, or cabbage moths. This is a great workshop for homeowners that are interested in saying goodbye to their lawns and replacing them with a more eye-catching, sustainable landscape or for land managers in the Northwest. </p>
<ul>
<li><u>How to prep your site.</u> This topic will cover how to remove lawns and other nonnative plants without the use of chemicals</li>
<li><u>How to develop a planting plan.</u> This topic will cover flower colors and shapes that attract various pollinators, host plants, and other factors to consider when selecting species, such as plant height, bloom time, and life cycle </li>
<li><u>How to successfully propagate native plants.</u> This topic will cover wild seed collection and processing (e.g. cold stratification and seed scarification), and will discuss planting times of native forbs and shrubs in the Northwest. </li></ul>
<p>Maya Goklany, M.S. is a Plant Ecologist and Volunteer Coordinator with the Walama Restoration Project, an environmental nonprofit based in Western Oregon. She has over 10 years of professional experience in the fields of botany and habitat restoration. In collaboration with the National Forest Service, Maya and her organization are currently working to establish the Mt. Hood Pollinator Garden using many of the techniques outlined in this workshop. She’s excited to share her passion for native plants with you.</p>
