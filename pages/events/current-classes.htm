Orchids in bloom make such beautiful gifts, but most of them fail to survive for long. At this workshop, Master Gardener Janis McBride will demonstrate step-by-step methods to help you easily turn those gifts into healthy, colorful, long-blooming orchids for your home. This hands-on class will give you an understanding of the natural growth pattern of the orchid, and how this influences orchid re-potting techniques. If you have one, you can bring your own gift orchid to be repotted. Pest management and nutrition will be covered briefly.</p>

Through close listening, careful observation, and a series of timed prompts, we’ll engage with the environment. We hope to be outside for part of the time, weather permitting.
