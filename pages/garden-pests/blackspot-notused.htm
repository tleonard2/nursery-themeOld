               <h3>Identify</h3>
               <p>Black spots with fringed margins that cannot be rubbed off the leaf.</p>

<h3>Monitor and Assess Damage</h3>

<p>How widespread the disease is will determine which route you should follow. Is it on just a few leaves?  Has it spread to at least half the plant? If it is just a handful of leaves then removing them is probably the best course of action.</p>

<h3>Threshold</h3>

<p>Since Black spot is quite common here even if you are diligent the threshold should realistically allow for a few bad leaves. If large numbers of leaves (a third or more) are affected Black spot can cause large-scale leaf drop.  This stresses the plant which can invite other problems to take hold.</p>

<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>Choosing disease resistant varieties can greatly reduce problems associated with rose care. See our list of <a target="_blank" href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/roses/RosesListFragrant2021.pdf">Disease Resistant Roses</a>.</p>

	<p>Good hygiene is critical. Disease spores can overwinter on branches and dead plant material, so start by removing fallen leaves and dead canes.</p>

	<p>Good air flow also discourages fungal problems.</p>

	<p>Well-fed plants are better fortified to fend off pests and disease.  Dormant sprays can also be invaluable for disease-prone varieties.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Cultural practices would include minimizing any overhead watering since splashing water from an infected plant can spread spores to healthy leaves.</p>

<p>The mechanical approach would be the physical removal of affected leaves as well as cleaning up any fallen leaf debris. This alone may be enough to prevent further infection.</p>

<p>If disease pressures remain low to moderate, safer sprays like neem and bacillus subtilis can be used in cooler weather.</p>

<p>Sulfur can be effective in temperatures from 60-85 degrees.  More severe infections may require treatment with copper or synthetic fungicides like Immunox.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> applications of any remedy should take into account flower time and the presence of bees and other beneficial insects.</p>
