                               <h3>Best Practices for controlling pests</h3>

                <p>The <strong>Best Practices</strong> approach, sometimes called <strong>Integrated Pest Management</strong> (IPM) is an environmentally sensitive approach to dealing with garden pests. This approach uses the scientific understanding of pests and diseases to determine if a problem requires treatment, and if so, how to proceed in the safest effective way while taking into account the specific sensitivities of the site.</p>

                <p><em>Some factors to consider when choosing a solution to your pest problem:</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What is the safety of the applicator?</li>

                    <li>What is the solution's impact on people and pets (safety and other factors)?</li>

                    <li>Is there a potential for runoff and what are the consequences for groundwater?</li>

                    <li>Does the solution pose a threat to beneficial insects?</li>

                    <li>What is the persistence in the environment (how long does it stick around)?</li>

                    <li>What is the best timing of the treatment to mitigate the above factors?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps to Best Practices for Pest Control</h3>

                <p>Our best practice definitions provide you with clear steps for finding the best way to solve garden problems. Best practices are assured when these steps are applied in each situation:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the weed, pest or disease</li>

                    <li>Monitor pest numbers, spread of weeds, or extent of disease damage.</li>

                    <li>Decide what Threshold of infestation requires action. Can the damage be tolerated? Is it really an issue that requires treatment?</li>

                    <li>Could Prevention eliminate the need for future treatment (appropriate plant selection, cultural controls)?</li>

                    <li>Control the problem using the safest effective biological, cultural, mechanical/physical and chemical tools.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>It should be noted that Best Practices is not Synthetic vs. Organic. If control is warranted then it is a matter of choosing the right tool to achieve an acceptable result that will minimize harm to humans, wildlife and the environment.</p>

                <p><strong>Biological control</strong> would consist of natural enemies: predators, parasites, pathogens, competitors (ladybugs, beneficial nematodes or bacillus strains, etc.).</p>

                <p><strong>Cultural controls</strong> would be practices that prevent of slow the spread of the problem (crop rotation, pruning, watering methods, etc.).</p>

                <p><strong>Mechanical and physical methods</strong> would include traps for pests, bird netting, row covers, mulching, and removing pests by hand.</p>

                <p><strong>Chemical control</strong> would be the safest effective pesticides, fungicides or herbicides.</p>

                <p>For an in-depth explanation of these steps please see our brochure <a href="https://portlandnursery.com/docs/bestpractice-solutions/BestPracticesBP.pdf" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i>Best Practices for Integrated Pest Management</a>.</p>

                <p>Our staff is happy to help identify the correct Best Practices approach for you. Just bring a picture or leaf sample in to our information desk, we will take it from there.</p>

 <h2>Who's bugging you?</h2>

                <figure><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/pests/ladybug.jpg" alt="black spot on roses"></figure>

                <h3>There's some good bugs out there!</h3>

                <p>Many insects, fungi, and bacteria can benefit your garden in one way or another. Beneficials come in many shapes and sizes and each help your garden in their own way, including controlling pests and pollinating plants.</p>

                <p>Creating a suitable habitat in your garden will attract beneficials, helping you to have a sustainable garden and support native wildlife. When relying on beneficials as a form of pest control you must be patient and tolerant of a few pests in your garden, and some damage to your plants. Without a few pests around your beneficials won’t have anything to eat!</p>

                 <p>Invite beneficials into your Garden</p>

											<ol>
											<li><strong>Proper Identification:</strong> Black spots with fringed margins that cannot be rubbed off the leaf.  </li>
											<li><strong>Monitor and Assess the Amount of Damage:</strong> How widespread the disease is will determine which route you should follow.  Is it on just a few leaves?  Has it spread to at least half the plant?  If it is just a handful of leaves then removing them is probably the best course of action. </li>
											<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> Since Black spot is quite common here even if you are diligent the threshold should realistically allow for a few bad leaves. If large numbers of leaves (a third or more) are affected Black spot can cause large-scale leaf drop.  This stresses the plant which can invite other problems to take hold.   </li>
											<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Choosing disease resistant varieties can greatly reduce problems associated with rose care.  Good hygiene is critical.  Disease spores can overwinter on branches and dead plant material, so start by removing fallen leaves and dead canes.  Good air flow also discourages fungal problems.  Well-fed plants are better fortified to fend off pests and disease.  Dormant sprays can also be invaluable for disease-prone varieties. </li>
											<li><strong>Use a Combination of Biological, Cultural, Mechanical/Physical and Chemical Tools to Treat:</strong> The mechanical approach would be the physical removal of affected leaves as well as cleaning up any fallen leaf debris. This alone may be enough to prevent further infection. Cultural practices would include minimizing any overhead watering since splashing water from an infected plant can spread spores to healthy leaves. If disease pressures remain low to moderate, safer sprays like neem and bacillus subtilis can be used in cooler weather.  Sulfur can be effective in temperatures from 60-85 degrees.  More severe infections may require treatment with copper or synthetic fungicides like Immunox.  <strong>Note:</strong> applications of any remedy should take into account flower time and the presence of bees and other beneficial insects. </li>
											</ol>

											<p>As you can see, there is a basic formula one can follow when trying to figure out the proper approach to the various problems we face in our gardens. Starting with right plant/right place will go a long way to ensuring success. The old adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is very applicable here. Remember that gardening is a lifelong learning experience. Have fun and enjoy the process.</p>

									<p><strong>Powdery Mildew</strong> is fungus that appears on leaves and stems as white to grayish, talcum powder-like spots that grow larger and denser as the disease progresses.  Unlike most fungi, powdery mildew spores do not need water for germination and are most severe in warm, dry climates.  Summer’s warm days and cool  nights create favorable humidity needs for spore growth as do shady areas.</p>

									<p>The spores are spread by the wind and can overwinter on plants and plant debris.  Powdery mildews are host specific (i.e. – the mildew on roses is different from the one affecting grapes) – they cannot survive without the proper host plant.  Circumstances influencing the disease's severity include the variety of the host plant, age and condition of the plant, and weather conditions during the growing season.</p>

									<p>Powdery mildew is usually more unattractive than it is serious, though left unchecked it can reduce vegetable and fruit yields and affect their flavor.  Leaves may also turn yellow before dying and falling off.  Although plants can be weakened by an infection, they usually do not die. </p>

									<p>Some of the vegetable crops affected by powdery mildew include artichoke, beans, beets, carrot, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, melon, parsnip, peas, peppers, pumpkin, radicchio, radishes, squash, tomatillo, tomatoes, and turnips.  The growing tips of fruit trees may also develop the disease.  Many ornamentals, such as lilacs, zinnias, and roses can also get infected.  Succulent tissue is most susceptible to infection.</p>

							                <p><strong>Impatiens Downy Mildew</strong> is a deadly fungal disease which thrives in moist, humid conditions. It specifically infects <em>Impatiens walleriana</em> and hybrids, bedding Impatiens (6 pack style), Rosebud Impatiens, Butterfly and Fusion Impatiens. Early signs include:</p>

							                <ul>
							                    <li>Light green yellowing or stippling of leaves</li>

							                    <li>Leaf edges curl down</li>

							                    <li>Faint gray streaks on upper leaf surface</li>

							                    <li>White cotton-­like patches on undersides of leaves</li>
							                </ul>

							                <p>Diligence is an important part of dealing with pest and disease problems in your garden. The sooner the better, but realize that a completely sterile environment is not only impossible but unhealthy as well in that you need to encourage a balance.</p>
