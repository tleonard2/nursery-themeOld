                    <p>Take your extra produce to where it can be used is easy: visit the <a href="http://www.oregonfoodbank.org/?c=129205297208324636" target="_blank">Oregon Food Bank website</a> to see the list of the produce that works best for food boxes.</p>

                    <p>Stop in at the information desk at either Portland Nursery location and see the Oregon Food Bank notebook for neighborhood maps to find the closest food pantry. And as a thank you from us, take home a free packet of seeds! &quot;&hellip;because no one should be hungry.&quot; (OFB)</p>

                    <p><strong>Helping those who help others in this season of giving</strong></p>

                    <p>Portland Nursery has donated $500 to Growing Gardens&rsquo; efforts to raise the necessary money by December 31 to receive a $25,000 matching grant from The Oregon Community Foundation &ndash; and in this season of giving, we would encourage everyone to join us in this effort for this worthy organization. Every donation, big or small, will add together in a meaningful way toward this goal.</p>

                    <p>It is easy to take for granted the ability to simply go shop for groceries, forgetting that too many of our neighbors still face food insecurity. A recent statistic indicates that as many as 200,000 Oregonians currently face hunger on a regular basis.</p>

                    <p>Growing Gardens has been tireless in their efforts to stem the tide of hunger in our area, by providing low income gardeners the tools and guidance to establish home gardens and start growing their own fresh, healthy food. They have helped to establish hundreds of gardens in backyards, apartment complexes and local schools, positively impacting the diets, health and lives of many of our citizens.</p>

                    <p>A garden is a gift that keeps on giving, indeed, as we at Portland Nursery and our customers well know.</p>

                    <p>See what they&rsquo;ve accomplished and what they&rsquo;re planning for 2010 at www.growing-gardens.org and consider helping Growing Gardens reach this important goal. No gift is too small, too big, too little, too much.</p>

                    <p class="clear">This an organization that, for nearly twelve years, has been working diligently to establish edible gardens in the homes and schools of our lower-income communities. <a href="growingGardens.shtml" target="_blank">Growing Gardens</a> has, with a very small staff and the help of hundreds of volunteers, been able to make steady and important progress in the fight against hunger in Portland.</p>

                    <p>Wishing our customers a warm and happy holiday, and an abundant gardening New Year.</p>
