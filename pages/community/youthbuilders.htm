	                <p>In 1993, a 22-member coalition came together to create a YouthBuild program in Portland, with the purpose of providing educational and leadership opportunities for low-income youth who had dropped out of high school.</p>

<p>Since its official incorporation in 1995, Portland YouthBuilders has overcome many challenges and risen in prominence to become a model chapter within the YouthBuild USA network. In 2012, for example, the organization was recognized for producing the highest performance outcomes among 300 YouthBuild programs nationwide. Such a tradition of success has tilled fertile grounds for some exciting new developments in the Lents neighborhood school.</p>

<p>A thriving garden allows students to take home their share in the harvest after a grueling day’s work on a construction site, and prepare meals from recipes they learned in earlier in the day. The organization’s mission, to empower young people “to become self-sufficient, contributing members of the workforce and their community”, finds unique expression in the garden-based nutrition program, where students learn about menu planning, budgeting and sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p>Through a 16-month program of academics, vocational training, career coaching and individual counseling, Portland YouthBuilders annually provides 200 low-income young people between the ages of 17 and 24 with the skills necessary to reach their life goals. In 2014, YouthBuilders introduced the garden-based nutrition program as a creative approach to improving its services. The program fosters cross-departmental collaborations and exposes students firsthand to the enriching experience of growing their own food and preparing meals for each other in the classroom.</p>

<p>Thanks to donations from Portland Nursery, the inaugural growing season yielded over 150 lbs. of produce, which included crops such as kale, fennel, radishes, turnips, lettuces, peas, squash and tomatoes. Through partnerships with Zenger Farms, Growing Gardens and the National College of Natural Medicine, Portland YouthBuilders exposes students to different ways of thinking about food and community.</p>

<p>On clear, sunny days in the garden, students are afforded views of Mount Hood in the distance--fitting for a program where students advance through phases named after famous mountains: from Hood, to Tahoma, then McKinley, and finally, Everest. At Portland YouthBuilders school garden, far beyond serving the basic nutritional needs of its students, every plant seems aglow with hope and potential, ready to launch its students to new heights.</p>
