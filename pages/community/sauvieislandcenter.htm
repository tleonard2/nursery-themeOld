                    <p><span class="clear">Located at Sauvie Island Organics farm and the adjacent historic Howell-Bybee house at a site preserved by Metro, Sauvie Island Center provides elementary school field trip groups with important environmental literacy experiences: learning about the different parts of plants, about what makes healthy soil, where food comes from, animals and the food chain.</span></p>

                    <p>Visit the <a href="http://www.sauvieislandcenter.org" target="_blank">Sauvie Island Center online.</a></p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/community/sauvie_center/gardening360.jpg" width="500" alt="Gardening at Sauvie Center">

                    <p class="clear">In a wide variety of fun, on-the-ground experiences led by a group of volunteer teachers, elementary and middle school-aged children are led through hands-on exercises that give them awareness of the natural world and a greater sense of their place in the whole.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/community/sauvie_center/fieldtrip360.jpg" width="500" alt="Gardening at Sauvie Center">

                    <p class="clear">They look for animal tracks in the woods near the house; they listen for frogs and learn about the different animals that live on the island and the parts they play in the local ecosystem; explore the giant compost pile to learn about the importance of decomposition and look for the creepy crawly inhabitants that help make it happen; they get to try their hand at growing food. For many of these urban youngsters, it is their first experience of this kind.</p>

                    <p>At a mere 20 miles from the center of town and even closer to the north Portland neighborhoods&rsquo; school children that make the trip via the St. Johns Bridge, Sauvie Island nevertheless feels strangely remote. Absent are the familiar traffic sounds of the city, the crowding of buildings; instead there are vast fields and farmland, dotted with cows and horses; hawks, herons and ducks fly overhead. There is a steady sound of birds and the startling sound of conversation and laughter as voices carry unexpectedly over large open spaces.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/community/sauvie_center/field360.jpg" width="500" alt="Gardening at Sauvie Center">

                    <p class="clear">A vital part program at Sauvie Island Center is based around growing and eating fresh food, making that important connection for children of where food comes from and how good freshly-picked food can taste. SIC has a designated row for their use in the acre that is farmed by the <a href="foodworks.shtml" target="_blank">Food Works</a> program; some of the <a href="foodworks.shtml" target="_blank">Food Works&rsquo;</a> teenaged crewmembers take time out of their farming chores to mentor these young eaters in how best to plant and take care of their crops. The &ldquo;Grow Lunch&rdquo; program gives them the opportunity to participate in every stage of food growing, including harvesting and preparing a fresh vegetable feast with the bounty they have grown.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://portlandnursery.com/plants/images/community/sauvie_center/tablekids360.jpg" width="500" alt="Gardening at Sauvie Center">

                    <p class="clear">For all those who visit <a href="http://www.sauvieislandcenter.org" target="_blank">Sauvie Island Center</a>, there is the excitement of discovery, the pride of accomplishment and delicious food too!</p>
