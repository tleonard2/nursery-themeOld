                    <p>It's true – Fall is for Planting! The soil is still warm, providing faster root growth and giving plants a head start on next year's growth.</p>

                    <p>By next summer, they will have a larger, more established root system than Fall plantings – means better drought tolerance and better flowering the first year. Also, the shorter days and mild temperatures in fall mean lower stress on new plants Last, but not least, the inevitable rains help keep those new plants watered-in, meaning less work for you (maybe a few days left to enjoy the hammock).</p>

                    <p>Exception: Plants that are frost tender, or borderline hardy for your area are best planted in the Fall, unless they are being put in a well-protected area.</p>

                    <p>You may have noticed some leaves changing color and starting to drop in the garden and around town. Your lawn grows best if not smothered in leaves, of course, but the leaves can be used either for composting or as mulch in the garden beds. If you are composting them, shred them first and then mix with ‘green’ compost material such as kitchen scraps. If you are mulching with them, consider shredding them with the lawnmower or other tool first. Whole-leaf mulch is a slug friendly environment, and doesn’t protect the roots quite as well.</p>

                    <p>Late October or November is a good time for mulching in general. While your leaves are great, you can also use compost, bark, straw, or other materials. Please see our <a href="#">article on mulching for more tips</a>.</p>

                    <p>As a few of our customers may have heard, October is for apple tasting around here. Feel free to join us mid-month for some family fun. Exact dates vary year to year.</p>

                    <h2>November</h2><img class="img-responsive img-seasonal pull-left" src="{{ 'assets/images/seasonal/november.jpg'|theme }}" alt="November tips">

                    <p>Cold weather is on the way, and the first freezing temperatures often happen in November in Portland. Those who live in outlying areas or higher elevations may have already experienced frost. Please see our December Tips page for several details about winterizing your yard and protecting your plants from cold damage.</p>

                    <p>November is usually the last chance of the season for any digging. If your soil is already saturated or frozen, it is not recommended. Assuming it is not, finish any planting of hardy plants or dividing of perennials. If you have vegetable or annual beds that are empty, consider a cover crop or some mulch to protect the soil from compaction or erosion in rain.</p>

                    <p>Speaking of which, this is one of the best times for mulching. You can use bark, compost, leaves, or straw. This will help to protect the surface roots of your plants from freezing air and reduce weed growth. Compost is good for soil health, but only helps so much with weeds. Bark is very good for weed control, but avoid turning uncomposted bark into your soil (now or in Fall) as it can limit the nitrogen that is available to your plants for some time. One to two inches of mulch is generally sufficient, and more than that is not better. Never place mulch so that it is touching the wooden stems of shrubs or trees.</p>
