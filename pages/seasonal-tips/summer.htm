                       <h2>June</h2>
                       <p>June marks the beginning of irrigation season unless May was unusually dry. Our <a href="tips_august.shtml" target="_blank">August tips page</a> has some detailed information on good watering techniques, and we encourage you to have a look there. Aside from that, know that June watering can be random; we might get shower after shower followed by a series of dry, hot days. Be ready to water, but do not do so unless the soil/plants are ready for it. Recent plantings always need more water than established plants, so make adjustments as necessary.</p>
<p>Mosquitos can start to be a pest now. Avoid standing water, or change it quite regularly. If that is impractical (ponds, etc.), consider mosquito dunks or another appropriate product to kill the larvae.</p>
<p>June can mean good planting weather. If we have an excessively wet spring, this might be the first time your clay-based soil is actually drying out and becomes easier to dig. It is a fine time for planting almost all types of plants, if you or someone is going to be around to water this summer. You cannot leave a June-planted tree, perennial, or vegetable bed to go without water during the summer that follows.</p>

                               <h2>July</h2>
                                <p>As these days get hotter watch (and increase) watering, especially for containers and hanging plants. Remember with all watering, that deep, thorough watering is still more important than frequency.</p>
      <p>Many vines start looking their best in summer including star jasmine, honeysuckle, climbing hydrangea, and passionflower. Regularly trim your established vines to keep them tidy and on their support structures. This can mean removal of some vines if a congested vine needs thinning or it can mean snipping off new growth for vines that are getting too long. For newer vines that are not yet grown in, regular doses of fertilizer can speed the process somewhat. Watch for powdery mildew on akebia and honeysuckle vines, especially if they are somewhat shaded.</p>

                               <h2>August</h2>
                                <p>Irrigation is the main activity that the gardener has to do frequently in August. The best way to water can vary greatly depending on the garden situation. Hanging baskets and full, healthy container plants can need a thorough watering every day, or occasionally more often. At the other end of the spectrum, established trees and large shrubs might not need any irrigation, or at most the occasional deep, thorough watering. Flower and vegetable beds and semi-established hardy plants fall somewhere in between. In such cases, always allow the soil surface to dry between waterings. Further, for plants with a root system that is at least somewhat developed allow the top layer of soil, say the top third to half of the estimated root system, to dry between waterings. You can test for moisture content in loose soils with your finger, or use a moisture meter in any soils. Be gentle when inserting the meter into packed or rocky soil as the tip can break off.</p>
				<p>If your plants wilt, it is likely because the soil in the root zone is fully dry. Before you water, however, make sure the soil is indeed dry; sometime plants in quite wet soils can show symptoms similar to dehydration. This leads to overwatering and sometimes to root rot or plant failure.</p>
				<p>Going on summer vacation? Hey, we can't blame you. That said, keeping the garden hydrated is always a priority to the gardener and you will need a plan. The best option is a friend, neighbor, or family member that can cover for you. While they may not know the nuances of your garden, they can probably figure out that the wilting annuals need a drink immediately. If that is not an option, consider getting yourself a timer and think through your irrigation system. A water timer can be attached to the hose spigot and set to turn the water on at certain intervals. Set the hose with sprinklers/drip system up so that it will cover the needs of your garden as best you can. We can help you get a tentative plan and provide the products needed to cover this.</p>
