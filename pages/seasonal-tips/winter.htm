                               <h2>December</h2>
                                <p>If you have pottery that you won't be using for winter, it is usually a good idea to empty them and store them where they will either be dry or free of frost. Terra cotta is especially prone to breaking when frozen. Also, bird baths can freeze and take damage if made of clay or stone. That said, birds still need water when the air is below freezing, so you might consider some temporary plastic containers be placed out if you are emptying your clay bird baths. Autumn to early winter is a good season to start a regular winter feeding schedule for your birds with seed or suet.</p>
            <p>When the weather is very cold and dry, your plants are more likely to suffer damage than in wet conditions or when snow covered. If cold, dry air is expected, water your plants beforehand. Make sure that you do not create puddles where someone might slip on an ice slick. Drain hoses and watering cans before a freeze. Consider having some burlap, bubble wrap, and/or frost blanket on hand for additional temporary protection during freezing conditions. In most cases, any wrap on plants should be temporary; do not leave it on all winter. Also, placing potted plants in semi-protected areas (up against the house, out of heavy wind) can give them a little help in winter.</p>
      <p>It is not advisable to dig or disturb the earth when it is either saturated or frozen. Mulch any unused areas until conditions are more favorable for planting or digging.</p>
              <p>Most of the leaves have fallen off of deciduous trees by mid-December, so it might be a good time for gutter cleaning, and watch for too much moss on the roof or walkways. We sell moss killing sprays for roofs, which can make the physical removal easier. To remove, use a long handled bristle scrub brush and scrape only down the slope of the roof. Scraping up can damage the bond between shingles. Always take precautions when working with roofs; moss and especially algae can be slippery and you are probably rather high in the air.</p>

                               <h2>January</h2>
                                <p>It is important to water your containerized plants before and during sub-zero temperatures when the air is dry and the wind is blowing. Please see the TIPS FOR WINTER WEATHER page for detailed information about protecting your garden from cold damage. For most of us, January is mostly about staying warm and planning ahead, but there are little things you can be doing to protect your plants, and any weeding you can do now means a lot less work later on.</p>
  <p>Did you have a cut Christmas tree this year? Don't leave it in the house too long, it becomes a fire hazard. Living (potted) Christmas trees should not be in the house longer than one week. In other words, by January the tree really needs to be back outside. Please see our <a href="https://www.portlandnursery.com/plants/docs/trees/Trees_Living_Christmas.pdf" target="_blank">brochure on living trees</a> for details to ensure your tree thrives.</p>

  Many species of birds overwinter in the Portland area, including some hummingbirds. Continuing to provide seed, suet, and nectar helps to keep populations healthy, and back door bird-watching is fun. When the temperature drops well below freezing, regularly placing plastic containers of water outside provides drinking water for them.</p>

                               <h2>February</h2>
                                <p>The weather in February is usually still quite harsh, and despite the frequent rainfall spells of dry freezing air are still possible. See our TIPS FOR WINTER WEATHER to keep your garden safe.</a> Note that the information in our monthly tips and on the care sheets is intended for gardening in the Portland, OR area and may not be accurate for higher elevations or different climates. </p>
<p>Aside from winter protection, this is a great time of year to watch out for weeds. As temperatures slowly rise, more species of weed start growing. It may not sound fun, but weeding now significantly reduces the number of weeds in spring.</p>
<p>Depending on your soil, it may still be too early to plant new hardy plants. Many Portlanders have a base of clay soil, and it is not recommended to disturb it significantly if it is still waterlogged. You probably won't kill the plants if you do plant them, but it can compact the soil more than is desirable.</p>
<p>This is the time of year for purchasing mason bee supplies. Mason bees are small, non-stinging, native bees that are very useful for pollination of early flowering fruit trees. In lower temperatures, they are more useful than honeybees. They do not form a hive, and are not dangerous to people. We sell supplies and even bees themselves to ensure they will be helping in your garden. <a href="../products/masonbees.shtml" title="Mason Bees" target="_blank">See our article about Mason Bees. </a></p>
