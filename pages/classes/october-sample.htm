<p>with Renee Stoops of Portland Nursery<br />
We regularly see a lot of winter stormwater in the PNW, even more so this past winter. We owe our temperate rainforest climate to this water, and there are ways to work with it successfully, as a blessing. Raingardens are a technical design approach accessible and affordable to homeowners and do-it-yourselfers. In fact, the City of Portland offers a discount on your water bill if this is done in conjunction with downspout disconnection.
Come learn the basic principles of raingarden design, ecology, and plant selection. Harvest an available water source and keep local streams cleaner for everyone. And broaden to a whole new type of landscaping combining environmental function with the beauty we are accustomed to in conventional gardening</p>
