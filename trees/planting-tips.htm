			<p>September marks the beginning of the autumn planting season. While it is possible to plant trees and shrubs in the heat of summer, it is often easier on the plant if you wait until the temperatures cool somewhat in September or October. Also, if you have clay soil it is often easier to dig in after the first significant shower of the autumn.</p>

			<p>We always stock up on conifers this time of year. Many of these are quite unusual and this is the only time of year that we get some of them. Be sure to stop by frequently to see what we have in new arrivals.</p>

			<h3>We've included a few planting tips for you this month:</h3>

			<h2>Planting &amp; Fertilizing</h2>

			<p>Dig a hole about twice the width of the rootball and the same depth. Break up soil in a wider area if possible. Drainage issues can be helped by mixing pumice thoroughly into planting soil. Pour ½ of an organic all-purpose fertilizer in hole and mix slightly.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://portlandnursery.com/newsletter/images/tree-sale-features/treeplanting.jpg" class="fr-fil fr-dii">Carefully remove the tree from container and loosen roots. If there are large, circling roots remove them. If the tree is a B&amp;B (balled and burlapped), cut the twine and open the ball. Leave burlap connected to roots intact, while trimming off any burlap that is not attached to the roots.</p>

			<p>Lower the tree into hole, setting it in hole at the same level as it was in the pot. If there is a graft (swollen point where trunk and roots join) it should remain at least 2” above ground. A buried graft may rot, killing the tree.</p>

			<p>Gently but firmly back-fill soil mixture into hole. If soil is dry, fill hole halfway and then water tree. After it drains, back-fill with remaining soil.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Mulch! Mulch! Mulch!</strong></p>

			<p>Add a ring of bark-based mulch around the base of the tree starting about 6" away from the trunk, covering the root zone. Mound bark higher around the outside edges to trap and hold water. Sprinkle remaining ½ of fertilizer onto soil ring. When done planting, water slowly and thoroughly, even if it's raining.</p>

			<h2>Staking</h2>

			<p>Drive stakes down 14” deep on either side of the tree – making sure not to damage the root ball. Attach green stretchy tape approx. 4 ½ feet up the stake, varying slightly depending on tree size. Wrap tape around trunk 360°, and attach back at the stake.</p>

			<p>Be sure to allow enough slack for tree to sway slightly in the wind, this will help it to build a strong root system, while protecting it from falling. Check the tightness of the tape periodically as the tree grows, replace it if it becomes too tight. Remove tape and stakes after 1 year.</p>

					<h2>After Care</h2>

					<p>During the first 2-3 years your tree will need to be watered occasionally. Frequency will depend on weather and soil retentiveness. To water effectively turn your hose on low, and let water slowly seep into the soil. Less frequent, deep watering is the goal. Let the hose run gently for 30-45 minutes. This will help the tree develop a strong, deep root system.</p>

					<p>Once established your tree probably won’t need any additional water. If you have any questions feel free to stop by our Information desk or give us a call.</p>
