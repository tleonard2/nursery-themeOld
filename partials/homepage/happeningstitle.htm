               <h3>Now that we’ve made the transition to fall, it’s time to start taking stock of the changes we’ve made while planning ahead for the seasonal changes soon to come—and with those plans, there’s always a lot of questions. What do you need to mulch? How do you care for the plants you’ve brought inside your home for the season? What can you plant now, and how can you continue to grow throughout the fall and winter? Portland Nursery is here to help answer all of those questions for you, and as you plan ahead for the holiday season, we’re also here to help make your home a festive one—with cut greens, mantle decorations, centerpieces, and wreath making classes (stay tuned for more on that).</h3>
