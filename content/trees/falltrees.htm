                        <p>This marks the beginning of the autumn planting season. While it is possible to plant trees and shrubs in the heat of summer, it is often easier on the plant if you wait until the temperatures cool somewhat in September or October. Also, if you have clay soil it is often easier to dig in after the first significant shower of the autumn.</p>
<p>We always stock up on conifers this time of year. Many of these are quite unusual and this is the only time of year that we get some of them. Be sure to stop by frequently to see what we have in new arrivals.  </p>
<p>Caterpillar damage is at its height in autumn. While many of the less damaging leaf eaters can be ignored because the leaves are going to fall off soon, tent caterpillars can do extensive damage if ignored. A large population can kill major braches of mature trees. Common targets include birch, ash, and maple. Insecticidal sprays can keep the population low.</p>
<p> Most trees and shrubs don&rsquo;t want to be fertilized this time of year. The only exception might be a little organic, slow-release food for newly planted evergreens, or those plants that have not been fed in a long time.</p>

	<h2>October</h2>
	<p>With temperatures moderate again, it is an excellent time for planting any hardy trees and shrubs. Your soil should be workable if it is moderately moist. Generally, planting now versus. next spring results in better roots before next summer, which is often the hardest season on recent plantings.</p>
	  <p>October to November is usually the best time for moving established shrubs if you feel you have to. Note that this is hard on plants, and isn&rsquo;t exactly recommended even this time of year. If the plant is small or recently planted you are more likely to have success.</p>
		<p>Note that any tender trees will need protection from freezing and you will need to move them in or otherwise protect them soon. Follow the links to  care sheets for each of the above plants. </p>
		<p>It is not quite pruning season yet. Enjoy the fall color, and then consider which trees may need pruning later on. See  our <a href="http://portlandnursery.com/docs/trees/Pruning_Calendar.pdf" target="_blank">pruning calendar</a> for more information. If you are unfamiliar with proper pruning techniques, consult our <a href="/trees/pruning-guide/">pruning page</a>.</p>
		<p>When mulching, make sure that the mulch is not in contact with the wooden stems or your plants. This can potentially cause damage or rot of the bark and underlying tissues.</p>

	<h2>November</h2>

<p>Many deciduous trees prefer to be pruned in late autumn or winter. Many deciduous trees prefer pruning be done during late autumn to early winter. Some examples are maples (<em>Acer spp.</em>), birches (<em>Betula spp.</em>), hornbeam (<em>Carpinus spp.</em>), beeches (<em>Fagus spp.</em>), and willows (<em>Salix spp.</em>). Other trees take pruning anytime in winter, such as Snowbell (<em>Styrax spp.</em>), Crape Myrtle (<em>Lagerstroemia spp.</em>), and dogwoods (<em>Cornus spp.</em>).</p>

<p>Dormant spraying can start in November. This means the application of particular pesticides while the plant is dormant. While many gardeners wait until February before spraying, multiple applications throughout the winter can benefit those plants with significant problems. Disease-prone fruit trees, roses, and lilacs often benefit from dormant spraying.</p>
	<p>If you have had disease problems with these or other trees and shrubs, then feel free to inquire with us about what can be done to help. Overwintering insect eggs can sometimes be controlled with other, oil-based dormant sprays.</p>
<p>Please note that while the products we have for dormant spraying are accepted for organic gardening practices, they can be dangerous to the applicator if misused. Always follow label precautions.</p>
